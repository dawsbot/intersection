Bill Maher wants to make sure supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) vote for the eventual Democratic presidential nominee -- even if it turns out to be Hillary Clinton.

It’s as easy as eating an airplane meal with chicken when they are all out of fish, he said Friday on HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher.”

Before sitting down to interview Sanders, Maher polled his studio audience to see how many of them supported Sanders and how many preferred Hillary Clinton.

Not surprisingly, Maher’s progressive audience members were feeling the Bern. Far more of them cheered when asked if they were backing Sanders than when asked if they were supporting Clinton.

“But if Bernie doesn’t get the nomination, who will stay home and not vote for [Hillary]?” Maher asked. Only one person clapped faintly to indicate she would not vote for the eventual Democratic nominee if it is Clinton.

Maher was pleased.

“See exactly,” he exclaimed. “We have two good candidates. It’s like on the airlines: Sometimes you don’t get the fish, you have the chicken. ‘I’ll eat the chicken if I have to!’”

Maher made clear that Sanders is still his first choice.

“So let me introduce the man, who, in my view, is chicken, fish and the kosher meal, Bernie Sanders!” Maher said.
