LIST OF SPORTS IDIOMS From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search This article is incomplete . Please help to improve it, or discuss the issue on the talk page . (September 2013)The following is a list of phrases from sports that have become idioms (slang or otherwise) in English. They have evolved usages and meanings independent of sports and are often used by those with little knowledge of these games.  The sport from which each phrase originates has been included immediately after the phrase. In some cases, the specific sport may not be known; these entries may be followed by the generic term sports , or a slightly more specific term, such as team sports (referring to such games as baseball, football, hockey, etc.), ball sports (baseball, tennis, volleyball, etc.), etc.  This list does not include idioms derived exclusively from baseball. The body of idioms derived from that sport is so extensive that two other articles are exclusively dedicated to them. See English language idioms derived from baseball and baseball metaphors for sex .

[ 5 ] down for the count; out for the count Boxing: To be defeated. Refers to a boxer being knocked down; the referee will count off ten seconds, the time allotted for the boxer to regain his feet or lose the fight.

[ 7 ] Compare take the full count , below. down to the wire Horse racing: To the very end or last minute. From the length of wire stretched across a racetrack at the finish line.

In games where a ball may be legally caught (e.g. baseball) or carried (e.g. American football), a player (or the player's team) may be penalized for dropping the ball; for example, an American football player who drops a ball ("fumbles") risks having the ball recovered and carried by the other team; in baseball, a player who drops a thrown or batted ball may be charged with an error.

In wrestling, it means to engage in a wrestling bout, the mat being the surface on which the contest is fought.

In boxing, it refers to Dementia pugilistica , a neurological disorder in boxers triggered by repeated dazing blows or punches to the head over an extended period of time; symptoms include dementia, inappropriate behaviour, slurring of speech, etc., which resemble symptoms of alcoholic intoxication (hence punch- drunk ). Figuratively, it refers to a state of dazedness or confusion resulting from fatigue, overwork, burnout, continuous exposure to unpleasant situations, or perhaps even emotional upheaval, as in suffering repeated figurative blows to one's ego, emotional well-being, etc. OED dates the boxing usage to 1918, the figurative to 1934.

[ 54 ] [ 55 ] ringside judge Boxing: A person who follows a topic or situation closely.

[ 62 ] See also bench . slam dunk , slam-dunk Basketball: A forceful, dramatic move, especially against someone.

[ 64 ] Figurative usage commonly includes the sense of "can't miss", a sure thing [ 65 ] slap-happy Boxing: Synonym for punch-drunk , above; also, dizzy with happiness; carefree, casual, thoughtless, irresponsible. The "punch-drunk" meaning OED cites to 1936; the "dizzy" meaning appears two years later.

Refers to a boxer who is hired to practise with another for training purposes. [ 67 ] Other phrases such as "sparring match" (for a verbal argument), and even the verb "to spar" (to bandy words), may actually come from cockfighting.

Batsmen who are out stumped do not often realise what has happened until they are asked to walk away from the pitch. sucker punch Boxing: An unexpected blow. In boxing, a sucker punch is one delivered unexpectedly. OED dates boxing term to 1947, but does not cite first figurative usage. Sunday punch Boxing: A destructive blow to an opponent as in "knocked him into next Sunday". In boxing, a Sunday punch is a knockout blow. WordNet refers to it specifically in terms of boxing.

Refers to boxers who would pretend to be knocked out by a light or even non-existent punch, thus intentionally losing the fight; this was one method of losing a "fixed" fight (one with an unlawfully prearranged outcome). OED gives the boxing reference as 1952, the non-boxing in 1982. [ 71 ] Also in football take it on the chin Boxing: To suffer misfortune or defeat. It alludes to taking a physical blow on the chin; AHDI dates this usage to the "first half of [the] 1900s"; [ 72 ] OED, however, qualifies this definition, adding "courageously", and citing its first use to 1928. [ 73 ] take off the gloves Boxing, ice hockey: To attack earnestly, without mercy. Boxing gloves are worn for protection of the boxer's hands and to lessen the impact of the punches; bare-knuckle boxing is much more savage and dangerous. Used also in ice hockey, as two (or more) players signal their intention to fight by dropping their gloves. Often used as in the gloves are off , meaning the fight or dispute has escalated (CIDI [ 74 ] ). This phrase may derive from earlier forms; the boxing sense OED cites to 1922, the figurative to 1928.

(1860) [ 76 ] The phrase throw in the towel in a non-boxing sense first dates to 1916 in a book by C. J. Dennis . [ 76 ] throw one's hat into the ring Boxing: To signify one's candidacy for (political) office or election; to enter a contest.

[ 78 ]U [ EDIT ] under the wire Horse racing: At the very last moment; in the nick of time; barely within some accepted parameters or limits. "The report was handed in just under the wire."

Association football , shown above, is a team sport which also provides opportunities to nurture physical fitness and social interaction skills.Sport ( UK ) or sports ( US ) are all forms of usually competitive physical activity which, [ 1 ] through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing entertainment to participants, and in some cases, spectators. [ 2 ] Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods , to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion . Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season , followed in some cases by playoffs . Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing , many contestants may compete, each against all with one winner.  Sport is generally recognised as activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity , with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, [ 3 ] and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. [ 2 ] However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports . The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF ) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord , the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] although limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports. [ 1 ]  Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs , which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.  Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news . Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues , and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting . Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.  According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. [ 6 ] The world's most accessible and practised sport is running , while association football is its most popular spectator sport.

[ 9 ]  Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise. [ 10 ] Roget's defines the noun sport as an "activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement" with synonyms including diversion and recreation. [ 11 ]  NOMENCLATURE The singular term "sport" is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept (e.g. "children taking part in sport"), with "sports" used to describe multiple activities (e.g. "football and rugby are the most popular sports in England"). American English uses "sports" for both terms.  DEFINITION See also: Game § Definitions The International Olympic Committee recognizes some board games as sports including Chess . Show Jumping , an equestrian sportThe precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources. The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by SportAccord , which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including association football , athletics , cycling , tennis , equestrian sports and more), and is therefore the de facto representative of international sport.  SportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should: [ 1 ]   * have an element of competition  * be in no way harmful to any living creature  * not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as arena football )  * not rely on any "luck" element specifically designed into the sport  They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as rugby or athletics ), primarily mind (such as chess or go ), predominantly motorised (such as Formula 1 or powerboating ), primarily co-ordination (such as billiard sports ), or primarily animal-supported (such as equestrian sport ). [ 1 ]  The inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports. [ 12 ] Whilst SportAccord recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to admitting any further mind sports.  There has been an increase in the application of the term "sport" to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as electronic sports , especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations.  COMPETITION There are opposing views on the necessity of competition as a defining element of a sport, with almost all professional sport involving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee(IOC) or SportAccord. [ 1 ]  Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity. For instance, the Council of Europe include all forms of physical exercise, including those completed just for fun.  In order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school sports days , although moves like this are often controversial. [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  In competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their "result" and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e.g. gender, weight and age). The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and corrected with "handicaps" or penalties. In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective measurement. In gymnastics or diving the result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjective. There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.  HISTORY Main article: History of sport Roman bronze reduction of Myron 's Discobolos , 2nd century AD.Artifacts and structures suggest sport in China as early as 2000 BC. [ 15 ] Gymnastics appears to have been popular in China's ancient past. Monuments to the Pharaohs indicate that a number of sports, including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated several thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt . [ 16 ] Other Egyptian sports included javelin throwing, high jump, and wrestling. Ancient Persian sports such as the traditional Iranian martial art of Zourkhaneh had a close connection to warfare skills. [ 17 ] Among other sports that originate in ancient Persia are polo and jousting .  Motorized sports have appeared since the advent of the modern age Electronic sports are a recent development.A wide range of sports were already established by the time of Ancient Greece and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the Peloponnesus called Olympia . [ 18 ]  Sports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has brought increased leisure time , letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes — all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports.  FAIR PLAY SPORTSMANSHIP Main article: Sportsmanship See also: Gamesmanship and Winning isn't everything; it's the only thingSportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports journalist Grantland Rice , that it's "not that you won or lost but how you played the game", and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder Pierre de Coubertin : "The most important thing... is not winning but taking part" are typical expressions of this sentiment.  CHEATING See also: Match fixing and cheatingKey principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win. Rules are in place to ensure that fair play to occur, but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage.  Participants may choose to cheat in order to satisfy their desire to win, or in order to achieve an ulterior motive. The widespread existence of gambling on the results of sports fixtures creates the motivation for match fixing , where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome.  DOPING AND DRUGS Main article: Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sportThe competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means .  All sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances.  VIOLENCE Violence in sports involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration. Rioting or hooliganism by fans in particular is a problem at some national and international sporting contests.  PARTICIPATION GENDER PARTICIPATION Fernanda Brito of Chile playing women's doubles tennis at Wimbledon in 2010. This section requires expansion . (March 2012) See also: Women's sports and Women's sports in the United StatesFemale participation in sports continues to rise alongside the opportunity for involvement and the value of sports for child development and physical fitness . Despite gains during the last three decades, a gap persists in the enrollment figures between male and female players. Female players account for 39% of the total participation in US interscholastic athletics. Gender balance has been accelerating from a 32% increase in 1973–74 to a 63% increase in 1994–95. Hessel (2000). [ full citation needed ]  YOUTH PARTICIPATION This section requires expansion . (March 2012)Youth sports present children with opportunities for fun, socialization, forming peer relationships, physical fitness, and athletic scholarships . Activists for education and the war on drugs encourage youth sports as a means to increase educational participation and to fight the illegal drug trade . According to the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital , the biggest risk for youth sports is death or serious injury including concussion . These risks come from running, basketball, football, volleyball, soccer, gymnastics, and ice hockey. [ 22 ]  DISABLED PARTICIPATION A runner gives a friendly tap on the shoulder to a wheelchair racer during the Marathon International de Paris (Paris Marathon) in 2014. See also: Disabled sportsDisabled sports also adaptive sports or parasports , are sports played by persons with a disability , including physical and intellectual disabilities . As many of these based on existing sports modified to meet the needs of persons with a disability, they are sometimes referred to as adapted sports . However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no equivalent in able-bodied sports.  SPECTATOR INVOLVEMENT Spectators at the 1906 unofficial Olympic Games Main article: Spectator sportThe competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played. This has led to the specific phenomenon of spectator sport .  Both amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person at the sport venue, and through broadcast mediums including radio , television and internet broadcast. Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge, such as an entrance ticket, or pay-per-view television broadcast.  It is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences, leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain fixtures. The football World Cup attracts a global television audience of hundreds of millions; the 2006 final alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700 million and the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final attracted an estimated audience of 135 million in India alone . [ 23 ]  In the United States , the championship game of the NFL , the Super Bowl , has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Super Bowl Sunday is a de facto national holiday in America; [ 26 ] [ 27 ] the viewership being so great that in 2015, advertising space was reported as being sold at $ 4.5m for a 30-second slot. [ 24 ]  ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS AMATEUR AND PROFESSIONAL Modern sports have complex rules and are highly organized. See also: professional sport and amateur sportSport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or semi-professional basis, depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a wage or salary ). Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called "grassroots sport". [ 2 ] [ 28 ]  The popularity of spectator sport as a recreation for non-participants has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right, and this has incentivised a high paying professional sport culture, where high performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages, which can run into millions of dollars. [ 29 ]  Some sports, or individual competitions within a sport, retain a policy of allowing only amateur sport . The Olympic Games started with a principle of amateur competition with those who practiced a sport professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a hobby. [ 30 ] From 1971, Olympic athletes were allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship, [ 31 ] and from 1986, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics, [ 31 ] [ 32 ] with the exceptions of boxing , [ 33 ] [ 34 ] and wrestling. [ 35 ] [ 36 ]  TECHNOLOGY Technology plays an important part in modern sports. With it being a necessary part of some sports (such as motorsport), it is used in others to improve performance. Some sports also use it to allow off-field decision making.  Sports science is a widespread academic discipline, and can be applied to areas including athlete performance, such as the use of video analysis to fine-tune technique, or to equipment, such as improved running shoes or competitive swimwear . Sports engineering emerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport, from analytics and big data to wearable technology . [ 37 ] In order to control the impact of technology on fair play, governing bodies frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between participants. For example, in 2010, full-body, non-textile swimsuits were banned by FINA , as they were enhancing swimmers' performances. [ 38 ] [ 39 ]  In 2014, new technology led to the introduction of hybrid engines in Formula One in 2014 , as a way of increasing fuel efficiency. [ 40 ] The cars use an energy recovery system similar to, but more effective than, the KERS system that was previously used, which recovers energy from braking and the exhaust. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Another innovation is the Drag reduction system , which involves opening a slot in a car's rear wing, to reduce aerodynamic drag in order to increase top speed and promote overtaking in motor racing. [ 43 ] It has been used in Formula One since 2011, [ 44 ] Formula Renault 3.5 since 2012, [ 45 ] and Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters since 2013. [ 46 ]  The increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports matches to be taken, or reviewed, off-field, with another official using instant replays to make decisions. In some sports, players can now challenge decisions made by officials. In football , Goal-line technology makes decisions on whether a ball has crossed the goal line or not. [ 47 ] The technology is not compulsory, [ 48 ] but was used in the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, [ 49 ] and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada, [ 50 ] as well as in the Premier League from 2013–14 , [ 51 ] and the Bundesliga from 2015–16 . [ 52 ] In the NFL , a referee can ask for a review from the replay booth, or a head coach can issue a challenge to review the play using replays. The final decision rests with the referee. [ 53 ] A video referee (commonly known as a Television Match Official or TMO) can also use replays to help decision-making in rugby (both league and union ). [ 54 ] [ 55 ] In international cricket, an umpire can ask the Third umpire for a decision, and the third umpire makes the final decision. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Since 2008, a decision review system for players to review decisions has been introduced and used in ICC -run tournaments, and optionally in other matches. [ 56 ] [ 58 ] Depending on the host broadcaster, a number of different technologies are used during an umpire or player review, including instant replays, Hawk-Eye , Hot Spot and Real Time Snickometer . [ 59 ] [ 60 ] Hawk-Eye is also used in tennis to challenge umpiring decisions. [ 61 ] [ 62 ]  POLITICS This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2010) Main article: Politics and sportsSports and politics can influence each other greatly.  Benito Mussolini used the 1934 FIFA World Cup , which was held in Italy , to showcase Fascist Italy . [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Adolf Hitler also used the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin , and the 1936 Winter Olympics held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen , to promote the Nazi ideology of the superiority of the Aryan race , and inferiority of the Jews and other " undesirables ". [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Germany used the Olympics to give of itself a peaceful image while it was very actively preparing the war. [ 66 ]  When apartheid was the official policy in South Africa , many sports people, particularly in rugby union , adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects. [ 67 ]  In the history of Ireland , Gaelic sports were connected with cultural nationalism . Until the mid 20th century a person could have been banned from playing Gaelic football , hurling , or other sports administered by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) if she/he played or supported football , or other games seen to be of British origin. Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and rugby union at Gaelic venues. This ban is still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in Croke Park while Lansdowne Road was redeveloped into Aviva Stadium . Until recently, under Rule 21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the RUC from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.  Nationalism is often evident in the pursuit of sports, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue, as in the Football War . These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sports being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.  A very famous case when sports and politics collided was the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli olympic team and killed many of their men. This was known as the Munich massacre .  A study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the results. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5 percent. A loss had the opposite effect, and the effect is greater for higher-profile teams or unexpected wins and losses. [ 68 ] Also, when Washington Redskins win their final game before an election, then the incumbent President is more likely to win, and if the Redskins lose, then the opposition candidate is more likely to win; this has become known as the Redskins Rule .

(February 2007)A sports league is a group of sports teams or individual athletes that compete against each other in a specific sport . At its simplest, it may be a local group of amateur athletes who form teams among themselves and compete on weekends; [ 1 ] at its most complex, it can be an international professional league making large amounts of money and involving dozens of teams and thousands of players.

This is especially common in individual sports, although the term "league" is sometimes used in amateur individual sports such as golf . [ 2 ]  The term "league" is also sometimes applied to competitions that would more traditionally be called tournaments , such as the UEFA Champions League , which is organized with multiple small round-robin competitions followed by a single elimination tournament to choose an overall winner.  LEAGUES AND LEAGUE SYSTEMS [ EDIT ] "League" and its synonyms may be used to encompass either a single competition or a related group of competitions. In the United States, leagues are often divided into subdivisions on historical or geographical lines. These may be referred to as conferences or divisions , as with the National Football Conference and American Football Conference in the National Football League , or the Eastern and Western Conferences of the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League . The NFL's "AFC" was formed largely from the remnants of the American Football League , though it also contains three original NFL teams and three expansion teams.  Baseball has a unique nomenclature, with " Major League Baseball " the name of the overall grouping of 30 teams in two "major leagues," the American League and the older National League . These are titled leagues rather than conferences for several reasons. The National League predates the American by 25 years and was considered a "major" league in comparison to its early competitors, and in a sense it simply extended this recognition to the AL, the only league of similar financial clout. In addition, the leagues played no interlocking schedule of any kind until 1995, and then added only a small amount of interleague play , with the main AL-NL competition occurring between their champions in the World Series . Thus the two leagues played mostly separate competitions within the larger framework of MLB. Finally, until 2000, they were actually separate legal entities, unlike the conferences of other leagues. Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan has a similar history, with the Central League and Pacific League not originally founded together.  Due to this naming custom, it is common to use slightly different terms to discuss MLB. Where someone might refer to "the best quarterback in the league" and be understood to mean the overall NFL, a similar mention of "the best outfielder in the league" is almost always a reference to the American or National League, and "all of baseball" or similar is used to denote the larger status. Each of the major leagues also has its own set of awards to recognize the separation between the two, which means there are two MVPs , two Cy Young winners, etc. And since its name is constructed differently—a description of the status of two leagues rather than the title of one—it is common to hear "MLB" without "the" attached to it, as in "the most home runs in MLB this year," since one would not say "the Major League Baseball."  In all four of the major North American sports, regardless of whether the subsets are called "league" or "conference," they each have their own subsets, all of which are called "divisions." These are geographically based, and teams play their divisional opponents more than any others, especially in the NFL and MLB.  In other parts of the world, and especially in association football , where promotion and relegation is common, the term "league" may be used to refer both to a league system , a group of leagues that are tied together in a hierarchical fashion by promotion and relegation, and to the individual leagues within the league system. For example, the Football League in England and the Bundesliga in Germany are both association football league systems .  LEAGUE ORGANIZATION [ EDIT ] The common thread between all sports leagues is a structure that allows teams or individuals to compete against each other in a nonrandom order on a set schedule, usually called a "season," with the results of the individual competitions being used to name an overall champion.  A league championship may be contested in a number of ways. Each team may play every other team a certain number of times in a round-robin tournament . Usually, teams play equal number of games or matches at their own stadium and at other teams', because home advantage is a major factor in many sports. When teams competing for a tournament championship do not play the same teams the same number of times, it is known as an unbalanced schedule.  In such a set-up, the team with the best record becomes champion, based on either a strict win-loss-tie system or on a points system where a certain number of points are awarded for a win, loss, or tie, while bonus points might also be added for teams meeting various criteria. Many leagues also use playoffs , where after teams compete in a regular season in a league format, the top teams (possibly determined by conference or division) advance to the playoffs. In some such leagues having the best regular season record is relatively unimportant, though top-seeded teams in some leagues, such as the NFL , can gain byes to later rounds of the playoffs, and teams finishing with the best records usually have the advantage of playing the weakest teams that have advanced to the playoffs.  ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL LEAGUE ORGANIZATION [ EDIT ] While round-robin and modified round-robin competitions are the most common form of league organization, there are a number of ways to organize a sporting competition, almost all of which may be described as a "league". Many sports organizations fall on a continuum between a total lack of organization, as in a pick-up game, and a formal league such as is common at the highest level of professional team sports.  NON-LEAGUE SPORTS [ EDIT ] The simplest form of competition is to allow teams to play each other whenever they see fit. In some sports, such as horse racing , the main goal of the entrants is to win individual purses , and there is little or no ranking or competition outside of winning certain major races. A small amount of league organization may be imposed on these non-league sports by way of a series or tournament tying several individual events together, such as the Triple Crown .  Even in team sports that normally use a traditional league format, some teams often exist outside of any league; these teams are generally known as barnstorming teams and either schedule games against local professional or amateur competition or bring their own competition, such as the barnstorming Harlem Globetrotters did when they toured with the Washington Generals . As with the Globetrotters, barnstorming teams sometimes emphasize spectacle over athletic competition.  In Europe, the term "cup competition" is used to describe single elimination or knock-out tournaments, where the pairing of teams in each round is determined by a "draw" (see for example, the FA Cup in England), to distinguish it from league competition, in which every club in the league or division plays the other teams a pre-determined number of times in a season, usually on a home and away basis.  Further, in England, the term non-league football is used for historical reasons to describe association football teams that play in organized leagues, but not in the Football League or Premier League , the two highest levels of competition in that sport in that country.  Independent baseball is used similarly in the United States to describe baseball teams that play in leagues other than those sanctioned by Major League Baseball . These teams do play in leagues and should not be confused with barnstorming teams that play truly non-league schedules.  RANKINGS AND LEADERBOARDS [ EDIT ] Individual sports often use an alternative type of league organization where competitors are ranked against each other. In the simplest cases, such as boxing , the rankings mean little and the major competition is to crown a champion in a title fight.  In other sports, the rankings and leaderboards gain importance when they are used in seeding tournaments. In some cases, as in NASCAR or the PGA Tour , points are assigned to individual competitions and the resulting points are used to determine a champion at the end of each season. While not usually referred to as "leagues," these season-long competitions with set events are very similar to league structures in team sports.  CONFERENCES AND INFORMAL LEAGUES [ EDIT ] American college sports are traditionally organized into groups of teams known as "conferences." [ 3 ] These conferences ordinarily keep league tables and crown champions within the conference, as other sports leagues do, but the individual school also schedule a certain number of "non-conference" games that are organized independently between two schools in different conferences, or between a conference team and a non-conference team. Also, national championships in some college sports are determined by a ranking or playoff system that is independent of the individual conferences.  ROUND-ROBIN SPORTS LEAGUES [ EDIT ] Most major team sports play some form of round-robin schedule, where the goal is for each team to play a relatively balanced schedule with each other team in the league or in its league subdivision. Within this structure, there are a few significant differences between leagues, a few of which are set forth below.  SINGLE-TABLE VERSUS UNBALANCED SCHEDULE [ EDIT ] The simplest way to organize a sports league, and still one of the most common, is in a double round-robin format where each team plays each other team twice, once at home and once away. This ensures that every team plays an equally difficult schedule and that no team has undue home field advantage . This organization is still used in many team sports around the world.  One potential drawback of this simple double round-robin format is that the number of teams in the league determines the schedule. Larger leagues may not be able to play as many games as such a system would require, and smaller leagues may want more games. In addition, leagues whose teams are geographically spread out over a wide area (a common situation for leagues in North America) may face significant travel costs. One solution is to play an unbalanced schedule, with some teams playing additional games against some other teams; this is the way Major League Soccer has traditionally been scheduled, with the additional games being played against local rivals. Some leagues also break the league into subunits, often known as "divisions" and "conferences," each of which may itself play a balanced or unbalanced schedule.  CUPS, TOURNAMENTS AND PLAYOFFS [ EDIT ] Many sports leagues also participate in a single-elimination tournament each year. In the United States, Mexico, and some other countries, these tournaments are commonly called "playoffs" and are played at the end of the season, with the teams qualifying for the playoffs based on their performance during the season. In Europe, "cup" competitions are more common, with all teams playing in a single-elimination tournament that takes place during and parallel with the regular season.

It has 30 franchised member clubs (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada ), and is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB), [ 1 ] which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States. The NBA is one of the four major North American professional sports leagues . NBA players are the world's best paid sportsmen, by average annual salary per player. [ 2 ]  The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). [ 3 ] The league adopted the name National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with its rival National Basketball League (NBL). The league's several international as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head offices located in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue in New York City. NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey .

Only New York , Boston , and Detroit still have the same franchise.The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada . On November 1, 1946, in Toronto , Ontario , Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens , in a game the NBA now regards as the first played in its history. [ 4 ] The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters . For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948–49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional. [ 5 ]  The headquarters of the National Basketball Association in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue , Midtown Manhattan , New York City , USA . [ 6 ]Following the 1948–49 season, the BAA took in the remainder of the NBL: Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo. In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed from the BAA to the National Basketball Association in spite of having the same BAA governing body including Podoloff. [ 5 ] The new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities, [ 7 ] as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1953–54, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises, all of which are still in the league (the New York Knicks , Boston Celtics , Golden State Warriors , Los Angeles Lakers , Royals/Kings , Detroit Pistons , Atlanta Hawks , and Nationals/76ers ). The process of contraction saw the league's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks shifted from the "Tri-Cities" (the area now known as the Quad Cities ), to Milwaukee in 1951, and then to St. Louis, Missouri in 1955; the Royals from Rochester, New York to Cincinnati in 1957; and the Pistons from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Detroit in 1957.  Japanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in the 1947–48 season when he played for the New York Knicks . He remained the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African-American, Harold Hunter , signing with the Washington Capitols in 1950. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Hunter was cut from the team during training camp, [ 8 ] [ 10 ] but several African-American players did play in the league later that year, including Chuck Cooper with the Celtics, Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton with the Knicks, and Earl Lloyd with the Washington Capitols . During this period, the Minneapolis Lakers, led by center George Mikan , won five NBA Championships and established themselves as the league's first dynasty . [ 11 ] To encourage shooting and discourage stalling, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock in 1954. [ 12 ] If a team does not attempt to score a field goal (or the ball fails to make contact with the rim) within 24 seconds of obtaining the ball, play is stopped and the ball given to its opponent.  CELTICS' DOMINANCE, LEAGUE EXPANSION AND COMPETITION In 1957, rookie center Bill Russell joined the Boston Celtics , who already featured guard Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach , and went on to lead the club to eleven NBA titles in thirteen seasons. Center Wilt Chamberlain entered the league with the Warriors in 1959 and became a dominant individual star of the 1960s, setting new single game records in scoring ( 100 ) and rebounding (55). Russell's rivalry with Chamberlain became one of the greatest rivalries in the history of American team sports.  Bill Russell defending Wilt Chamberlain in 1966.The 1960s were dominated by the Celtics. Led by Russell, Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach, Boston won eight straight championships in the NBA from the 1959–66. This championship streak is the longest in NBA history. They did not win the title in 1966–67 , but regained it in the 1967–68 season and repeated in 1969 . The domination totaled nine of the ten championship banners of the 1960s. [ 13 ]  Through this period, the NBA continued to strengthen with the shift of the Minneapolis Lakers to Los Angeles , the Philadelphia Warriors to San Francisco , the Syracuse Nationals to Philadelphia to become the Philadelphia 76ers , and the St. Louis Hawks moving to Atlanta , as well as the addition of its first expansion franchises. The Chicago Packers (now Washington Wizards ) became the ninth NBA team in 1961. From 1966 to 1968, the league expanded from 9 to 14 teams, introducing the Chicago Bulls , Seattle SuperSonics (now Oklahoma City Thunder ), San Diego Rockets (who relocated to Houston four years later), Milwaukee Bucks , and Phoenix Suns .  In 1967, the league faced a new external threat with the formation of the American Basketball Association (ABA). The leagues engaged in a bidding war. The NBA landed the most important college star of the era, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor). However, the NBA's leading scorer, Rick Barry , jumped to the ABA, as did four veteran referees— Norm Drucker , Earl Strom , John Vanak, and Joe Gushue. [ 14 ]  In 1969, Alan Siegel , who oversaw the design of Jerry Dior's Major League Baseball logo a year prior, created the modern NBA logo inspired by the MLB's. It incorporates the silhouette of the legendary Jerry West based on a photo by Wen Roberts, although NBA officials denied a particular player as being its influence because, according to Siegel, "They want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it. It's become such a ubiquitous, classic symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing program that they don't necessarily want to identify it with one player." The iconic logo debuted in 1971 and would remain a fixture of the NBA brand. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]  The ABA succeeded in signing a number of major stars in the 1970s, including Julius Erving of the Virginia Squires , in part because it allowed teams to sign college undergraduates. The NBA expanded rapidly during this period, one purpose being to tie up the most viable cities. From 1966 to 1974, the NBA grew from nine franchises to 18. In 1970, the Portland Trail Blazers , Cleveland Cavaliers , and Buffalo Braves (now the Los Angeles Clippers ) all made their debuts expanding the league to 17. [ 17 ] The New Orleans Jazz (now in Utah ) came aboard in 1974 bringing the total to 18. Following the 1976 season, the leagues reached a settlement that provided for the addition of four ABA franchises to the NBA, raising the number of franchises in the league at that time to 22. The franchises added were the San Antonio Spurs , Denver Nuggets , Indiana Pacers , and New York Nets (now the Brooklyn Nets). Some of the biggest stars of this era were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Rick Barry , Dave Cowens , Julius Erving , Elvin Hayes , Walt Frazier , Moses Malone , Artis Gilmore , George Gervin , Dan Issel , and Pete Maravich . The end of the decade, however, saw declining TV ratings, low attendance and drug-related player issues – both perceived and real – that threatened to derail the NBA.  SURGING POPULARITY Los Angeles Lakers' Magic Johnson and Boston Celtics' Larry Bird in Game Two of the 1985 NBA Finals at Boston Garden .The league added the ABA's innovative three-point field goal beginning in 1979 to open up the game. That same year, rookies Larry Bird and Magic Johnson joined the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers respectively, initiating a period of significant growth in fan interest in the NBA throughout the country and the world. In 1984 they played against each other for the first time in the NBA Finals. Johnson went on to lead the Lakers to five titles, and Bird went on to lead the Celtics to three. Also in the early 1980s, the NBA added one more expansion franchise, the Dallas Mavericks , bringing the total to 23 teams. Later on, Larry Bird won the first three three-point shooting contests. Former league commissioner David Stern who took office on February 1, 1984 before retiring February 1, 2014, oversaw the expansion and growth of the NBA to a global commodity.  Michael Jordan going in for a dunkMichael Jordan entered the league in 1984 with the Chicago Bulls , providing an even more popular star to support growing interest in the league. This resulted in more cities demanding teams of their own. In 1988 and 1989, four cities got their wishes as the Charlotte Hornets , Miami Heat , Orlando Magic , and Minnesota Timberwolves made their NBA debuts, bringing the total to 27 teams. In the first year of the 1990s, the Detroit Pistons would win the second of their back-to-back titles, led by coach Chuck Daly and guard Isiah Thomas. Jordan and Scottie Pippen would lead the Bulls to two three-peats in eight years during the 1991–98 seasons. Hakeem Olajuwon won back-to-back titles with the Houston Rockets in 1994 and 1995.  The 1992 Olympic basketball Dream Team , the first to use current NBA stars, featured Michael Jordan as the anchor, along with Bird, Johnson, David Robinson , Patrick Ewing , Scottie Pippen, Clyde Drexler , Karl Malone , John Stockton , Chris Mullin , Charles Barkley , and Christian Laettner . Eleven players on the Dream Team have been inducted individually into the Basketball Hall of Fame.  In 1995, the NBA expanded to Canada with the addition of the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors . In 2001, the Vancouver Grizzlies relocated to Memphis , which left the Raptors as the only Canadian team in the NBA.  In 1996, the NBA created a women's league, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).  In 1998, the NBA owners began a lockout which lasted 191 days and was settled on January 18, 1999. As a result of this lockout the 1998–99 NBA season was reduced from 82 to 50 games (61% of a normal season), and the All-Star Game was cancelled. The San Antonio Spurs won their first championship, and first by a former ABA team, by beating the New York Knicks , who were the first, and to this date, the only, eighth seed to ever make it to the NBA Finals.  MODERN ERA Since the breakup of the Chicago Bulls championship roster in the summer of 1998, the Western Conference has dominated, with the Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs combining to win the title nine out of fourteen seasons. Tim Duncan and David Robinson won the 1999 championship with the Spurs , and Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant started the 2000s with three consecutive championships for the Lakers. The Spurs reclaimed the title in 2003 against the Nets . In 2004, the Lakers returned to the Finals , only to fall in five games to the Detroit Pistons .  Dirk Nowitzki and John Wall in action as the Dallas Mavericks face the Washington Wizards in 2011After the Spurs took home the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy in 2005 , the 2006 Finals featured two franchises making their inaugural Finals appearances. The Miami Heat , led by their star shooting guard, Dwyane Wade , and Shaquille O'Neal, who had been traded from the Lakers during the 2004 summer, won the series over the Dallas Mavericks in six after losing the first two games. The Lakers/Spurs dominance continued in 2007 with a four-game sweep by the Spurs over the Cleveland Cavaliers , who were led by LeBron James . The 2008 Finals saw a rematch of the league's highest profile rivalry , the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers , with the Celtics winning, for their 17th championship, thanks to their new big three of Paul Pierce , Ray Allen , and Kevin Garnett .  In 2009, Kobe Bryant and the Lakers returned to the Finals , this time defeating the Dwight Howard-led Orlando Magic . [ 18 ] Bryant won his first Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his 13th season after leading the Lakers to their first NBA championship since the departure of Shaquille O'Neal. [ 19 ]  The 2010 NBA All-Star Game was held at Cowboys Stadium in front of the largest crowd ever, 108,713. [ 20 ] At the end of that season, the Celtics and the Lakers renewed their rivalry from 2008 when they met again in the NBA Finals for a record 12th time. The Lakers won the title by winning Game 7, 83–79. [ 21 ] Before the start of the 2010–11 season the NBA had an exciting summer with one of the most anticipated free agent classes of all time. Two of which signed, and one resigned, with the Miami Heat, leading to a season that was heavily centered on their eventual success or failure at taking home the championship. The Heat, led by LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, did in fact make the Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, in a rematch for the franchises of the 2006 Finals. The Mavericks, led by Dirk Nowitzki (the eventual NBA Finals MVP), took the series in six games. This was the Mavericks' first title. Veterans Shawn Marion , Jason Kidd, Jason Terry , and Peja Stojaković celebrated their first NBA championship.  On July 1, 2011, at 12:01 am, the NBA announced another lockout . [ 22 ] After the first few weeks of the season were canceled, the players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement on December 8, 2011, setting up a shortened 66-game season. [ 23 ] Following the shortened season, the Miami Heat made a return to the Finals with the trio of Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Chris Bosh against Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden. The Heat went on to defeat the Thunder in five games, capturing their second NBA title in six years.  INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE Further information: List of foreign NBA playersFollowing pioneers like Vlade Divac ( Serbia ) and Dražen Petrović ( Croatia ) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Below is a short list of foreign players who have won NBA awards or have been otherwise recognized for their contributions to basketball, either currently or formerly active in the league:   * Šarūnas Marčiulionis , Lithuania – 2014 inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame .

Notable examples are:   * Nigerian Hakeem Olajuwon ( top draft pick in 1984 , 2-time champion, 12-time All-Star, 1994 MVP, 1994 and 1995 Finals MVP, 1994 and 1995 Defensive Player of the Year, only player to receive the MVP Award, Defensive Player of the Year Award, and Finals MVP award in the same season, and Hall of Famer)  * Congolese Dikembe Mutombo (Four time NBA Defensive Player of the Year , selected fourth overall by the Denver Nuggets in the 1991 NBA Draft and 8-time NBA All-Star)  * Dutchman Rik Smits (1988 second overall pick, 1998 NBA All-Star, played 12 years for the Indiana Pacers)  * German Detlef Schrempf (Sixth Man Award winner in 1991 and 1992, 3-time All-Star)  * Canadian Steve Nash (2005 and 2006 MVP)  * Australians Luc Longley (3-time champion with the Bulls in the 1990s) and Andrew Bogut , ( top draft pick in 2005 ).  * Sudanese-born Englishman Luol Deng (2007 winner of the NBA Sportsmanship Award )  Since 2006, the NBA has faced Euroleague teams in exhibition matches in the NBA Europe Live Tour and since 2009 in the Euroleague American Tour .  The 2013–14 season opened with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 countries and comprising over 20% of the league [ 24 ] The NBA defines "international" players as those born outside the 50 United States and Washington, D.C. This means that:   * Players born in U.S. possessions such as Puerto Rico and the U.S., Virgin Islands , most notably USVI native Tim Duncan , are counted as "international" even though they are U.S. citizens by birth, and may even have represented the U.S. in international competition (like Duncan).  * U.S.-born players are not counted as "international" even if they were born with citizenship in another country and represent that country internationally, such as Joakim Noah .  OTHER DEVELOPMENTS In 2001, an affiliated minor league , the National Basketball Development League, now called the NBA Development League (or D-League) was created. [ 25 ] Before the league was started, there were strong rumors that the NBA would purchase the Continental Basketball Association , and call it its developmental league.  In 2004, two years after the Hornets' relocation to New Orleans , the NBA returned to North Carolina as the Charlotte Bobcats were formed as an expansion team .  In 2005, the Hornets relocated to Oklahoma City for two seasons because of damage caused by Hurricane Katrina . In 2007, the Hornets returned to New Orleans.  On June 28, 2006, a new official game ball was introduced for the 2006–07 season, marking the first change to the ball in over 35 years and only the second ball in 60 seasons. [ 26 ] Manufactured by Spalding , the new ball featured a new design and new synthetic material that Spalding claimed offered a better grip, feel, and consistency than the original ball. However, many players were vocal in their disdain for the new ball, saying that it was too sticky when dry, and too slippery when wet.  On December 11, 2006, Commissioner Stern announced that beginning January 1, 2007, the NBA would return to the traditional leather basketball in use prior to the 2006–07 season. The change was influenced by frequent player complaints and confirmed hand injuries (cuts) caused by the microfiber ball. [ 27 ] The Players' Association had filed a suit in behalf of the players against the NBA over the new ball. [ 28 ] As of 2006, the NBA team jerseys are manufactured by Adidas , which purchased the previous supplier, Reebok .  On July 19, 2007, the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated allegations that veteran NBA referee Tim Donaghy bet on basketball games he officiated over the past two seasons and that he made calls affecting the point spread in those games. [ 29 ] On August 15, 2007, Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation. However, he could face additional charges if it is determined that he deliberately miscalled individual games. Donaghy claimed in 2008 that certain refs were friendly with players and "company men" for the NBA. Donaghy alleged that refs influenced the outcome of certain playoff and finals games in 2002 and 2005. NBA commissioner David Stern denied the allegations and said Donaghy was a convicted felon and a "singing, cooperating witness". [ 30 ] Donaghy served 15 months in prison and was released in November 2009. [ 31 ] According to an independent study by Ronald Beech of Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings, although the refs increased the Lakers' chances of winning through foul calls during the game, there was no collusion to fix the game. On alleged "star treatment" during Game 6 by the refs toward certain players, Beech claimed, "there does seem to be issues with different standards and allowances for different players." [ 32 ]  On July 2, 2008, it was announced that the Seattle SuperSonics would relocate to Oklahoma City . The Oklahoma City Thunder began playing in the 2008–09 season.  On October 11, 2008, the Phoenix Suns and the Denver Nuggets played the first outdoor game in the modern era of the NBA at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden . [ 33 ]  On September 1, 2009, the contract between the NBA and its referees expired, creating a referee lockout. On October 1, 2009, the first preseason games were played and replacement referees from the WNBA and NBA Development League were used. The last time replacement referees were used was the beginning of the 1995–96 season. [ 34 ] The NBA and the regular referees reached a deal on October 23, 2009. [ 35 ]  In 2011, the first official NBA league games on European ground took place. In two matchups, the New Jersey Nets faced the Toronto Raptors in London 's O2 Arena in front of over 20,000 fans.  In July 2011, the NBA laid off around 114 league employees (about 11 percent of all the league office workforce) to save money. [ 36 ]  The 2011–12 NBA season , scheduled to begin November 1, 2011, with a matchup between the defending champion Dallas Mavericks and the Chicago Bulls, was postponed due to a labor dispute . The lockout officially ended on December 8, 2011, when players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement, and the season began on Christmas Day.  On April 30, 2012, the New Jersey Nets officially changed their name to the Brooklyn Nets . They began playing in the New York City borough of Brooklyn in the 2012–13 season.  In October 2012, the NBA announced that it would begin fining players for flopping . [ 37 ]  After the 2012–13 season, the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the Pelicans. During the 2013–14 season, Stern retired as commissioner after 30 years, and deputy commissioner Adam Silver ascended to the position of commissioner. During that season's playoffs, the Bobcats officially reclaimed the Hornets name, and by agreement with the league and the Pelicans, also received sole ownership of all history, records, and statistics from the Pelicans' time in Charlotte. As a result, the Hornets are now officially considered to have been founded in 1988, suspended operations in 2002, and resumed in 2004 as the Bobcats, while the Pelicans are officially treated as a 2002 expansion team. [ 38 ] (This is somewhat similar to the relationship between the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens in the NFL .)  In April 2014 Donald Sterling , an NBA owner at the time, received a lifetime ban from the NBA after racist remarks he made became public.  On August 5, 2014, Becky Hammon was hired by the San Antonio Spurs as an assistant coach, becoming the second female coach in NBA history but the first full-time coach. [ 39 ] This also makes her the first full-time female coach in any of the four major professional sports in North America.

The United States is home to 29 teams and one is located in Canada.  The current league organization divides thirty teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004–05 season . Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: thirteen teams are in the Eastern Time Zone , nine in the Central , three in the Mountain , and five in the Pacific .

An asterisk (*) denotes a franchise move. See the respective team articles for more information.  2. The Fort Wayne Pistons , Minneapolis Lakers and Rochester Royals all joined the NBA ( BAA ) in 1948 from the NBL .  3. The Syracuse Nationals and Tri-Cities Blackhawks joined the NBA in 1949 as part of the BAA-NBL absorption.  4. The Indiana Pacers, New York Nets , San Antonio Spurs, and Denver Nuggets all joined the NBA in 1976 as part of the NBA- ABA merger .  5. The Charlotte Hornets are regarded as a continuation of the original Charlotte franchise. Because of this, the New Orleans Pelicans are no longer the same franchise as the original Charlotte Hornets. The Hornets were known as the Bobcats from 2004–2014. The New Orleans Pelicans were established in 2002. The Bobcats/Hornets rejoined the league in 2004.  REGULAR SEASON Following the summer break, teams begin training camps in late September. Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare the players for the rigorous regular season, and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the NBA development league. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October.  During the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure means the strength of schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the NFL or MLB ). Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).  The NBA is one of only two of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada in which teams play every other team during the regular season (the other being the National Hockey League ). Each team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season. From 2005 to 2008, the NBA had the distinction of being the only one of the four major leagues in which all teams play every other team.  The NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on Christmas Day. [ 40 ] The league has been playing games regularly on the holiday since 1947, [ 41 ] though the first Christmas Day games weren't televised until 1983–84 . [ 42 ] Games played on this day have featured some of the best teams and players. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Christmas is also notable for NBA on television, as the holiday is when the first NBA games air on network television each season. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Games played on this day have been some of the highest-rated games during a particular season.  In February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual NBA All-Star Game . Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the Internet , and the top vote-getters at each position in each conference are given a starting spot on their conference's All-Star team. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then, Eastern conference players face the Western conference players in the All-Star game. The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a Game MVP award . Other attractions of the All-Star break include the Rising Stars Challenge (originally Rookie Challenge), where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the world; the Skills Challenge , where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the Three Point Contest , where players compete to score the most amount of three-point field goals in a given time; and the NBA Slam Dunk Contest , where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights.  Shortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline , which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3pm Eastern Time . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.  Around the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, post-season teams. The Sixth Man of the Year Award is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league's best defender. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The Most Valuable Player Award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, Sporting News awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) Executive of the Year Award to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.  The post-season teams are the All-NBA Team , the All-Defensive Team , and the All-Rookie Team ; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There are also two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position.  PLAYOFFS Main article: NBA Playoffs The Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy is awarded to the winner of the NBA Finals .NBA Playoffs begin in late April, with eight teams in each conference competing for the Championship. The three division winners, along with the team with the next best record from the conference are given the top four seeds. The next four teams in terms of record are given the lower four seeds.  Having a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed, the second seed plays the seventh seed, the third seed plays the sixth seed, and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed, having a higher seed means a team faces a weaker team in the first round. The team in each series with the better record has home court advantage, including the First Round. This means that, for example, if the team who receives the 5 seed has a better record than the team with the 4 seed (by virtue of a divisional championship), the 5 seed would have home court advantage, even though the other team has a higher seed. Therefore, the team with the best regular season record in the league is guaranteed home court advantage in every series it plays. For example, in 2006, the Denver Nuggets won 44 games and captured the Northwest Division and the #3 seed. Their opponent was the #6 seed Los Angeles Clippers , who won 47 games and finished second in the Pacific Division. Although Denver won its much weaker division, the Clippers had home-court advantage and won the series in 5.  The playoffs follow a tournament format. Each team plays an opponent in a best-of-seven series, with the first team to win four games advancing into the next round, while the other team is eliminated from the playoffs. In the next round, the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same conference. All but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs. Since the NBA does not re-seed teams, the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional design, with the winner of the series matching the 1st and 8th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 4th and 5th seeded teams, and the winner of the series matching the 2nd and 7th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 3rd and 6th seeded teams. In every round, the best-of-7 series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 home-court pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6. From 1985 to 2013, the NBA Finals followed a 2–3–2 pattern, meaning that one team had home court in games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other played at home in games 3, 4, and 5. [ 45 ]  The final playoff round, a best-of-seven series between the victors of both conferences, is known as the NBA Finals , and is held annually in June. The victor in the NBA Finals wins the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy . Each player and major contributor—including coaches and the general manager—on the winning team receive a championship ring. In addition, the league awards the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award to the best performing player of the series.  On August 2, 2006, the NBA announced the new playoff format. The new format takes the three division winners and the second-place team with the best record and rank them 1–4 by record. The other 4 slots are filled by best record other than those other 4 teams. [ 46 ] Previously, the top three seeds went to the division winners.  LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIPS Main article: List of NBA championsThe Boston Celtics have won the most championships with 17 NBA Finals wins. The second most successful franchise is the Los Angeles Lakers , who have 16 overall championships (11 in Los Angeles, 5 in Minneapolis). Following the Lakers, are the Chicago Bulls with six championships, all won over an 8-year span during the 1990s, and the San Antonio Spurs with five championships, all since 1999.

From 1987 to 1999 the NBA champions played against the continental champions of the Fédération Internationale de Basketball (FIBA) in the McDonald's Championship .

National Football League Current season, competition or edition: 2015 NFL season Formerly American Professional Football Conference (1920) American Professional Football Association (1920–1922) Sport American football Founded August 20, 1920 [ 1 ] Commissioner Roger Goodell Inaugural season 1920 No. of teams 32 Country United States [ A ] Most recent champion(s) New England Patriots (4th title) [ 2 ] Most titles Green Bay Packers (13 titles) [ 2 ] TV partner(s) CBS Fox NBC ESPN NFL Network Telemundo Official website NFL.com The headquarters of the National Football League at 345 Park Avenue , Midtown Manhattan , New York City , U.S. [ 3 ]The National Football League ( NFL ) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America , and the highest professional level of American football in the world. [ 4 ] The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from the week after Labor Day to the week after Christmas , with each team playing sixteen games and having one bye week . Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs , a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl , played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.  The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1923 season. The NFL agreed to merge with the American Football League (AFL) in 1966, and the first Super Bowl was held at the end of that season; the merger was completed in 1970. Today, the NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world [ 5 ] and is the most popular sports league in the United States. The Super Bowl is among the biggest club sporting events in the world [ 6 ] and individual Super Bowl games account for many of the most watched television programs in American history, all occupying the Nielsen's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015. [ 7 ] The NFL's executive officer is the commissioner, who has broad authority in governing the league.  The team with the most NFL championships is the Green Bay Packers with thirteen; the team with the most Super Bowl championships is the Pittsburgh Steelers with six. The current NFL champions are the New England Patriots , who defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28–24 in Super Bowl XLIX .

This meeting resulted in the formation of the American Professional Football Conference (APFC), a group who, according to the Canton Evening Repository , intended to "raise the standard of professional football in every way possible, to eliminate bidding for players between rival clubs and to secure cooperation in the formation of schedules". [ 8 ] Another meeting held on September 17, 1920 resulted in the renaming of the league to the American Professional Football Association (APFA). [ 8 ] The league hired Jim Thorpe as its first president, and consisted of 14 teams. Only two of these teams, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), remain. [ 9 ]  The Akron Pros won the first APFA (NFL) Championship.Although the league did not maintain official standings for its 1920 inaugural season and teams played schedules that included non-league opponents, the APFA awarded the Akron Pros the championship by virtue of their 8–0–3 (8 wins, 0 losses, and 3 ties ) record. [ 10 ] The following season resulted in the Chicago Staleys controversially winning the title over the Buffalo All-Americans . [ 11 ] In 1922, the APFA changed its name to the National Football League (NFL). [ 12 ]  In 1932 , the season ended with the Chicago Bears (6-1-6) and the Portsmouth Spartans (6-1-4) tied for first in the league standings. [ 13 ] At the time, teams were ranked on a single table and the team with the highest winning percentage (not including ties, which were not counted towards the standings) at the end of the season was declared the champion; the only tiebreaker was that in the event of a tie, if two teams played twice in a season, the result of the second game determined the title (the source of the 1921 controversy). This method had been used since the league's creation in 1920, but no situation had been encountered where two teams were tied for first. The league quickly determined that a playoff game between Chicago and Portsmouth was needed to decide the league's champion. The teams were originally scheduled to play the playoff game, officially a regular season game that would count towards the regular season standings, at Wrigley Field in Chicago , but a combination of heavy snow and extreme cold forced the game to be moved indoors to Chicago Stadium , which did not have a regulation-size football field. Playing with altered rules to accommodate the smaller playing field, the Bears won the game 9-0 and thus won the championship. Fan interest in the de facto championship game led the NFL, beginning in 1933 , to split into two divisions with a championship game to be played between the division champions. [ 14 ] The 1934 season also marked the first of 12 seasons in which African Americans were absent from the league . The de facto ban was rescinded in 1946 , following public pressure and coinciding with the removal of a similar ban in Major League Baseball . [ 15 ]  Up until the 1960s, the NFL was the dominant professional football league and faced little competition. Rival leagues included three separate American Football Leagues and the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), none of which lasted for more than four seasons, although several teams from the AAFC joined the NFL after the league dissolved in 1949.  A new professional league, the fourth American Football League (AFL), began play in 1960. The upstart AFL began to challenge the established NFL in popularity, gaining lucrative television contracts and engaging in a bidding war with the NFL for free agents and draft picks. The two leagues announced a merger on June 8, 1966, to take full effect in 1970. In the meantime, the leagues would hold a common draft and championship game. The game, the Super Bowl , was held four times before the merger, with the NFL winning Super Bowl I and Super Bowl II , and the AFL winning Super Bowl III and Super Bowl IV . [ 16 ] After the league merged, it was reorganized into two conferences: the National Football Conference (NFC), consisting of most of the pre-merger NFL teams, and the American Football Conference (AFC), consisting of all of the AFL teams as well as three pre-merger NFL teams. [ 17 ]  Today, the NFL is considered the most popular sports league in North America ; much of its growth is attributed to former Commissioner Pete Rozelle , who led the league from 1960 to 1989. Overall annual attendance increased from three million at the beginning of his tenure to seventeen million by the end of his tenure, and 400 million viewers watched 1989's Super Bowl XXIII . The NFL established NFL Properties in 1963. The league's licensing wing, NFL Properties earns the league billions of dollars annually; Rozelle's tenure also marked the creation of NFL Charities and a national partnership with United Way . [ 18 ] Paul Tagliabue was elected as commissioner to succeed Rozelle; his seventeen-year tenure, which ended in 2006, was marked by large increases in television contracts and the addition of four expansion teams, [ 19 ] as well as the introduction of league initiatives to increase the number of minorities in league and team management roles. [ 20 ] The league's current Commissioner, Roger Goodell , has focused on reducing the number of illegal hits and making the sport safer, mainly through fining or suspending players who break rules. [ 21 ] These actions are among many the NFL is taking to reduce concussions and improve player safety. [ 22 ]  SEASON AND PLAYOFF DEVELOPMENT Main article: List of National Football League seasonsFrom 1920 to 1934, the NFL did not have a set number of games for teams to play, instead setting a minimum. The league mandated a 12-game regular season for each team beginning in 1935 , later shortening this to 11 games in 1937 and 10 games in 1943 , mainly due to World War II . After the war ended, the number of games returned to 11 games in 1946 and to 12 in 1947. The NFL went to a 14-game schedule in 1961 , which it retained until switching to the current 16-game schedule in 1978 . [ 23 ] Proposals to increase the regular season to 18 games have been made, but have been rejected in labor negotiations with the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA). [ 24 ]  The NFL operated in a two-conference system from 1933 to 1966 , where the champions of each conference would meet in the NFL Championship Game . If two teams tied for the conference lead, they would meet in a one-game playoff to determine the conference champion. In 1967 , the NFL expanded from 15 teams to 16 teams. Instead of just evening out the conferences by adding the expansion New Orleans Saints to the seven-member Western Conference, the NFL realigned the conferences and split each into two four-team divisions. The four conference champions would meet in the NFL playoffs , a two-round playoff. [ 25 ] The NFL also operated the Playoff Bowl (officially the Bert Bell Benefit Bowl) from 1960 to 1969. Effectively a third-place game , pitting the two conference runners-up against each other, the league considers Playoff Bowls to have been exhibitions rather than playoff games. The league discontinued the Playoff Bowl in 1970 due to its perception as a game for losers. [ 26 ]  Following the addition of the former AFL teams into the NFL in 1970 , the NFL split into two conferences with three divisions each. The expanded league, now with twenty-six teams, [ 17 ] would also feature an expanded eight-team eight playoff, the participants being the three division champions from each conference as well as one 'wild card' team (the team with the best win percentage) from each conference. In 1978, the league added a second wild card team from each conference, bringing the total number of playoff teams to ten, and a further two wild card teams were added in 1990 to bring the total to twelve. When the NFL expanded to 32 teams in 2002 , the league realigned, changing the division structure from three divisions in each conference to four divisions in each conference. As each division champion gets a playoff bid, the number of wild card teams from each conference dropped from three to two. [ 27 ]  CORPORATE STRUCTURE See also: History of the NFL Commissioner NFL Commissioner Roger GoodellAt the corporate level, the National Football League considers itself a trade association made up of and financed by its 32 member teams. [ 28 ] Up until 2015, the league was an unincorporated nonprofit 501(c)(6) association. [ 29 ] Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code provides an exemption from federal income taxation for "Business leagues, chambers of commerce, real-estate boards, boards of trade, or professional football leagues (whether or not administering a pension fund for football players), not organized for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.". [ 30 ] In contrast, each individual team (except the non-profit Green Bay Packers [ 31 ] ) is subject to tax because they make a profit. [ 32 ] The NFL gave up the tax exempt status in 2015 following public criticism; in a letter to the club owners, Commissioner Roger Goodell labeled it a "distraction", saying "the effects of the tax exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years... Every dollar of income generated through television rights fees, licensing agreements, sponsorships, ticket sales, and other means is earned by the 32 clubs and is taxable there. This will remain the case even when the league office and Management Council file returns as taxable entities, and the change in filing status will make no material difference to our business". As a result, the league office might owe around US$ 10 million, but is no longer required to disclose the salaries of its executive officers. [ 33 ]  The league has three defined officers: the commissioner, secretary, and treasurer. Each conference has one officer, the president. The commissioner is elected by affirmative vote of two-thirds or 18 (whichever is greater) of the members of the league, while the president of each conference is elected by an affirmative vote of three-fourths or ten of the conference members. [ 34 ] The commissioner appoints the secretary and treasurer and has broad authority in disputes between clubs, players, coaches, and employees. He is the "principal executive officer " [ 35 ] of the NFL and also has authority in hiring league employees, negotiating television contracts, disciplining individuals that own part or all of an NFL team, clubs, or employed individuals of an NFL club if they have violated league bylaws or committed "conduct detrimental to the welfare of the League or professional football". [ 35 ] The commissioner can, in the event of misconduct by a party associated with the league, suspend individuals, hand down a fine of up to US$500,000, cancel contracts with the league, and award or strip teams of draft picks. [ 35 ]  In extreme cases, the commissioner can offer recommendations to the NFL's Executive Committee up to and including the "cancellation or forfeiture" [ 35 ] of a club's franchise or any other action he deems necessary. The commissioner can also issue sanctions up to and including a lifetime ban from the league if an individual connected to the NFL has bet on games or failed to notify the league of conspiracies or plans to bet on or fix games. [ 35 ] The current Commissioner of the National Football League is Roger Goodell, who was elected in 2006 after Paul Tagliabue , the previous commissioner, retired. [ 36 ]  SEASON FORMAT The NFL season format consists of a four-week preseason , a seventeen-week regular season (each team plays 16 games), and a twelve-team single-elimination playoff culminating in the Super Bowl, the league's championship game.  PRESEASON Main article: National Football League preseasonThe NFL preseason begins with the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game , played at Fawcett Stadium in Canton . [ 37 ] Each NFL team is required to schedule four preseason games, two of which must be at its home stadium, but the teams involved in the Hall of Fame game, as well as any teams playing in an American Bowl game, play five preseason games. [ 38 ] Preseason games are exhibition matches and do not count towards regular-season totals. [ 39 ] Because the preseason does not count towards standings, teams do not focus on winning games; instead, they are used by coaches to evaluate their teams and by players to show their performance, both to their current team and to other teams if they get cut. [ 24 ] The quality of preseason games has been criticized by some fans, who dislike having to pay full price for exhibition games, [ 40 ] as well as by some players and coaches, who dislike the risk of injury the games have, while others have felt the preseason is a necessary part of the NFL season. [ 24 ] [ 40 ]  REGULAR SEASON Main article: National Football League regular season AFC East AFC North AFC South AFC West 1st Patriots Steelers Colts Broncos 2nd Bills Bengals Texans Chiefs 3rd Dolphins Ravens Jaguars Chargers 4th Jets Browns Titans Raiders NFC East NFC North NFC South NFC West 1st Cowboys Packers Panthers Seahawks 2nd Eagles Lions Saints Cardinals 3rd Giants Vikings Falcons 49ers 4th Redskins Bears Buccaneers RamsThis chart displays the application of NFL scheduling formula for the New England Patriots (green) after the 2014 season. The Patriots finished first in the AFC East in the 2014 season, and will play the following teams in the 2015 regular season :   * One home and one away game against each of their fellow AFC East teams (blue)  * One game against each team in the AFC South (yellow), on a three-year rotation  * One game against each team in the NFC East (orange), on a four-year rotation  * The Denver Broncos and Pittsburgh Steelers (red) once each, due to their first-place finishes in their respective divisions  The National Football League runs a seventeen-week, 256-game regular season. Since 2001, the season has begun the week after Labor Day and concluded the week after Christmas . [ 41 ] The opening game of the season is normally a primetime home game for the league's defending champion. [ 42 ]  Most NFL games are played on Sundays, with a Monday night game typically held at least once a week and Thursday night games occurring on most weeks as well. [ 42 ] NFL games are not normally played on Fridays or Saturdays until late in the regular season, as federal law prohibits professional football leagues from competing with college or high school football. Because high school and college teams typically play games on Friday and Saturday, respectively, the NFL cannot hold games on those days until the third Friday in December. [ 43 ] NFL games are rarely scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday, and those days have only been used twice since 1948: in 2010, when a Sunday game was rescheduled to Tuesday due to a blizzard, and in 2012, when the Kickoff game was moved from Thursday to Wednesday to avoid conflict with the Democratic National Convention . [ 44 ] [ 45 ]  NFL regular season matchups are determined according to a scheduling formula. Within a division, all four teams play fourteen out of their sixteen games against common opponents - two games (home and away) are played against the other three teams in the division, while one game is held against all the members of a division from the NFC and a division from the AFC division as determined by a rotating cycle (three years for the conference the team is in, and four years in the conference they are not in). The other two games are intraconference games, determined by the standings of the previous year - for example, if a team finishes first in its division, it will play two other first-place teams in its conference, while a team that finishes last would play two other last-place teams in the conference. [ 46 ] In total, each team plays sixteen games and has one bye week, where they do not play any games. [ 47 ]  Although the teams any given club will play are known by the end of the previous year's regular season, the exact dates, times, and home/away status for NFL games are not determined until much later because the league has to account for, among other things, the Major League Baseball postseason and local events that could pose a scheduling conflict with NFL games. During the 2010 season, over 500,000 potential schedules were created by computers, 5,000 of which were considered "playable schedules" and were reviewed by the NFL's scheduling team. After arriving at what they felt was the best schedule out of the group, nearly 50 more potential schedules were developed to try and ensure that the chosen schedule would be the best possible one. [ 48 ]  POSTSEASON Main articles: National Football League playoffs and Pro Bowl The seeding bracket for the NFL playoffsFollowing the conclusion of the regular season, a twelve-team single elimination tournament, the NFL Playoffs, is held. Six teams are selected from each conference: the winners of each of the four divisions as well as two wild card teams (the two remaining teams with the best overall record). These teams are seeded according to overall record, with the division champions always ranking higher than either of the wild card teams. [ 49 ] The top two teams (seeded one and two) from each conference are awarded a bye week, while the remaining four teams (seeded 3-6) from each conference compete in the first round of the playoffs, the Wild Card round, with the third seed competing against the sixth seed and the fourth seed competing against the fifth seed. The winners of the Wild Card round advance to the Divisional Round, which matches the lower seeded team against the first seed and the higher seeded team against the second seed. The winners of those games then compete in the Conference Championships, with the higher remaining seed hosting the lower remaining seed. The AFC and NFC champions then compete in the Super Bowl to determine the league champion.  The only other postseason event hosted by the NFL is the Pro Bowl , the league's all-star game . The Pro Bowl is held the week before the Super Bowl . [ 50 ]  TROPHIES AND AWARDS TEAM TROPHIES Main articles: Vince Lombardi Trophy , Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy and Brunswick-Balke Collender CupThe National Football League has used three different trophies to honor its champion over its existence. The first trophy, the Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup , was donated to the NFL (then APFA) in 1920 by the Brunswick-Balke Collender Corporation . The trophy, the appearance of which is only known by its description as a "silver loving cup", was intended to be a traveling trophy and not to become permanent until a team had won at least three titles. The league awarded it to the Akron Pros, champions of the inaugural 1920 season; however, the trophy was discontinued and its current whereabouts are unknown. [ 51 ]  A second trophy, the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy , was issued by the NFL from 1934 to 1969. The trophy's namesake, Ed Thorp , was a referee in the league and a friend to many early league owners; upon his death in 1934, the league created the trophy to honor him. In addition to the main trophy, which would be in the possession of the current league champion, the league issued a smaller replica trophy to each champion, who would maintain permanent control over it. The current location of the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy, like that of its predecessor, is unknown. The predominant theory is that the Minnesota Vikings , the last team to be awarded the trophy, somehow misplaced it after the 1969 season. [ 52 ]  The current trophy of the NFL is the Vince Lombardi Trophy . The Super Bowl trophy was officially renamed in 1970 after Vince Lombardi , who as head coach led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowls. Unlike the previous trophies, a new Vince Lombardi Trophy is issued to each year's champion, who maintains permanent control of it. Lombardi Trophies are made by Tiffany & Co. out of sterling silver and are worth anywhere from $25,000 to $300,000. [ 53 ] Additionally, each player on the winning team as well as coaches and personnel are awarded Super Bowl rings to commemorate their victory. The winning team chooses the company that makes the rings; each ring design varies, with the NFL mandating certain ring specifications (which have a degree of room for deviation), in addition to requiring the Super Bowl logo be on at least one side of the ring. [ 54 ] The losing team are also awarded rings, which must be no more than half as valuable as the winners' rings, but those are almost never worn. [ 55 ]  The conference champions receive trophies for their achievement. The champions of the NFC receive the George Halas Trophy , [ 56 ] named after Chicago Bears founder George Halas , who is also considered as one of the co-founders of the NFL. The AFC champions receive the Lamar Hunt Trophy , [ 57 ] named after Lamar Hunt , the founder of the Kansas City Chiefs and the principal founder of the American Football League. Players on the winning team also receive a conference championship ring. [ 58 ] [ 59 ]  PLAYER AND COACH AWARDS See also: Category:National Football League trophies and awards .The NFL recognizes a number of awards for its players and coaches at its annual NFL Honors presentation. The most prestigious award is the AP Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. [ 60 ] Other major awards include the AP Offensive Player of the Year , AP Defensive Player of the Year , AP Comeback Player of the Year , and the AP Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year awards. [ 61 ] Another prestigious award is the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award , which recognizes a player's off-field work in addition to his on-field performance. [ 62 ] The NFL Coach of the Year award is the highest coaching award. [ 63 ] The NFL also gives out weekly awards such as the FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Week [ 64 ] and the Pepsi MAX NFL Rookie of the Week awards. [ 65 ]  MEDIA COVERAGE Main article: NFL on televisionIn the United States, the National Football League has television contracts with four networks: CBS , ESPN , Fox , and NBC . CBS televises Sunday afternoon AFC intraconference games, while Fox does likewise for the NFC. [ 66 ] If a game is interconference, the conference affiliation of the visiting team determines which network will host the game. Since 2011, the league has reserved the right to give games that, under the contract, would normally air on one network to the other network. [ 67 ] CBS also carries a package of eight games on Thursday nights during the 2014 season. NBC carries the primetime Sunday Night Football package, the NFL Kickoff game , and a primetime Thanksgiving Day game . ESPN carries all Monday Night Football games. [ 66 ] The NFL's own network, NFL Network , carries all Thursday Night Football games, including those on CBS but not the ones on NBC. [ 68 ]  The Super Bowl television rights are rotated on a three-year basis between CBS, Fox, and NBC. [ 66 ] In 2011, all four stations signed new nine-year contracts with the NFL, each running until 2022; CBS, Fox, and NBC are estimated by Forbes to pay a combined total of $3 billion a year, while ESPN will pay $1.9 billion a year. [ 69 ] The league also has deals with Spanish-language broadcasters Telemundo and ESPN Deportes , which air Sunday and Monday Night Football, respectively. [ 70 ] [ 71 ]  Through the 2014 season, the NFL had a blackout policy in which games were 'blacked out' on local television in the home team's area if the home stadium was not sold out. Clubs could elect to set this requirement at only 85%, but they would have to give more ticket revenue to the visiting team; teams could also request a specific exemption from the NFL for the game. The vast majority of NFL games were not blacked out; only 6% of games were blacked out during the 2011 season , [ 72 ] and only two games were blacked out in 2013 and none in 2014 . [ 73 ] The NFL announced in March 2015 that it would suspend its blackout policy for at least the 2015 season . [ 73 ] According to Nielsen , the NFL regular season since 2012 was watched by at least 200 million individuals, accounting for 80% of all television households in the United States and 69% of all potential viewers in the United States. NFL regular season games accounted for 31 out of the top 32 most-watched programs in the fall season and an NFL game ranked as the most-watched television show in all 17 weeks of the regular season. At the local level, NFL games were the highest-ranked shows in NFL markets 92% of the time. [ 74 ] Super Bowls account for the 22 most-watched programs (based on total audience) in US history, including a record 167 million people that watched Super Bowl XLVIII , the conclusion to the 2013 season. [ 75 ]  In addition to radio networks run by each NFL team, select NFL games are broadcast nationally by Westwood One (known as Dial Global for the 2012 season). These games are broadcast on over 500 networks, giving all NFL markets access to each primetime game. The NFL's deal with Westwood One was extended in 2012 and will run through 2017. [ 76 ]  On March 23, 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that the NFL would distribute the 2015 International Series game from Wembley Stadium in London between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars exclusively via Internet streaming, except for over-the-air broadcasts in the Buffalo and Jacksonville local markets. [ 77 ]  In 2015, the NFL began sponsoring a series of public service announcements to bring attention to domestic abuse and sexual assault in response to what was seen as poor handling of incidents of violence by players.

Each conference is divided into four divisions of four clubs each. During the regular season, each team is allowed a maximum of 53 players on its roster; [ 79 ] only 46 of these may be active (eligible to play) on game days. [ 80 ] Each team can also have an 10-player practice squad separate from its main roster, but the practice squad may only be composed of players who were not active for at least nine games in any of their seasons in the league. A player can only be on a practice squad for a maximum of three seasons. [ 81 ]  Each NFL club is granted a franchise, the league's authorization for the team to operate in its home city. This franchise covers 'Home Territory' (the 75 miles surrounding the city limits, or, if the team is within 100 miles of another league city, half the distance between the two cities) and 'Home Marketing Area' (Home Territory plus the rest of the state the club operates in, as well as the area the team operates its training camp in for the duration of the camp). Each NFL member has the exclusive right to host professional football games inside its Home Territory and the exclusive right to advertise, promote, and host events in its Home Marketing Area. There are several exceptions to this rule, mostly relating to teams with close proximity to each other: the San Francisco 49ers and Oakland Raiders only have exclusive rights in their cities and share rights outside of it; and teams that operate in the same city (e.g. New York Giants and New York Jets ) or the same state (e.g. California , Florida , and Texas ) share the rights to the city's Home Territory and the state's Home Marketing Area, respectively. The Los Angeles home territory has no team, but is "owned and controlled" by the league. [ 82 ]  Every NFL team is based in the contiguous United States . Although no team is based in a foreign country, the Buffalo Bills played one home game every season at the Rogers Centre in Toronto , Canada as part of the Bills Toronto Series from 2008 until 2013 , and the Jacksonville Jaguars will play one home game a year from 2013 to 2016 at Wembley Stadium in London , England as part of the NFL International Series . [ 83 ] Mexico also has hosted an NFL regular-season game, a 2005 game between San Francisco 49ers and Arizona dubbed " Fútbol Americano ", [ 84 ] and 39 international pre-season games were played from 1986 to 2005 as part of the American Bowl series. [ 85 ]  The Dallas Cowboys , at approximately $4 billion, are the most valuable NFL franchise according to Forbes [ 86 ] and the most valuable sports team in the world. All 32 NFL teams rank among the top 50 most valuable sports teams in the world. [ 87 ] Fourteen of the NFL's owners are listed on the Forbes 400 , the most of any sports league or organization.

The draft consists of seven rounds, with each of the 32 clubs getting one pick in each round. [ 97 ] The draft order for non-playoff teams is determined by regular-season record; among playoff teams, teams are first ranked by the furthest round of the playoffs they reached, and then are ranked by regular-season record. For example, any team that reached the divisional round will be given a higher pick than any team that reached the conference championships, but will be given a lower pick than any team that did not make the divisional round. The Super Bowl champion always drafts last, and the runner-up always drafts second-to-last. [ 98 ] All potential draftees must be at least three years removed from high school in order to be eligible for the draft. [ 99 ] Underclassmen that have met that criterion to be eligible for the draft must write an application to the NFL by January 15 renouncing their remaining college eligibility. [ 100 ] Clubs can trade away picks for future draft picks, but cannot trade the rights to players they have selected in previous drafts. [ 101 ]  Aside from the 32 picks each club gets, compensatory draft picks are given to teams that have lost more compensatory free agents than they have gained. These are spread out from rounds 3 to 7, and a total of 32 are given. [ 102 ] Clubs are required to make their selection within a certain period of time, the exact time depending on which round the pick is made in. If they fail to do so on time, the clubs behind them can begin to select their players in order, but they do not lose the pick outright. This happened in the 2003 draft , when the Minnesota Vikings failed to make their selection on time. The Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers were able to make their picks before the Vikings were able to use theirs. [ 103 ] Selected players are only allowed to negotiate contracts with the team that picked them, but if they choose not to sign they become eligible for the next year's draft. [ 104 ] Under the current collective bargaining contract, all contracts to drafted players must be four-year deals with a club option for a fifth. Contracts themselves are limited to a certain amount of money, depending on the exact draft pick the player was selected with. [ 105 ] Players who were draft eligible but not picked in the draft are free to sign with any club. [ 97 ]  The NFL operates several other drafts in addition to the NFL draft. The league holds a supplemental draft annually. Clubs submit emails to the league stating the player they wish to select and the round they will do so, and the team with the highest bid wins the rights to that player. The exact order is determined by a lottery held before the draft, and a successful bid for a player will result in the team forfeiting the rights to its pick in the equivalent round of the next NFL draft. [ 106 ] Players are only eligible for the supplemental draft after being granted a petition for special eligibility. [ 107 ] The league holds expansion drafts , the most recent happening in 2002 when the Houston Texans began play as an expansion team . [ 108 ] Other drafts held by the league include an allocation draft in 1950 to allocate players from several teams that played in the dissolved All-America Football Conference [ 109 ] and a supplemental draft in 1984 to give NFL teams the rights to players who had been eligible for the main draft but had not been drafted because they had signed contracts with the United States Football League or Canadian Football League . [ 110 ]  Like the other major sports leagues in the United States , the NFL maintains protocol for a disaster draft . In the event of a 'near disaster' (less than 15 players killed or disabled) that caused the club to lose a quarterback, they could draft one from a team with at least three quarterbacks. In the event of a 'disaster' (15 or more players killed or disabled) that results in a club's season being cancelled, a restocking draft would be held. Neither of these protocols has ever had to be implemented. [ 111 ]  FREE AGENCY Free agents in the National Football League are divided into restricted free agents , who have three accrued seasons and whose current contract has expired, and unrestricted free agents , who have four or more accrued seasons and whose contract has expired. An accrued season is defined as "six or more regular-season games on a club's active/inactive, reserved/injured or reserve/physically unable to perform lists". [ 112 ] Restricted free agents are allowed to negotiate with other clubs besides their former club, but the former club has the right to match any offer. If they choose not to, they are compensated with draft picks. Unrestricted free agents are free to sign with any club, and no compensation is owed if they sign with a different club. [ 112 ]  Clubs are given one franchise tag to offer to any unrestricted free agent. The franchise tag is a one-year deal that pays the player 120% of his previous contract or no less than the average of the five highest-paid players at his position, whichever is greater. There are two types of franchise tags: exclusive tags, which do not allow the player to negotiate with other clubs, and non-exclusive tags, which allow the player to negotiate with other clubs but gives his former club the right to match any offer and two first-round draft picks if they decline to match it. [ 113 ]  Clubs also have the option to use a transition tag , which is similar to the non-exclusive franchise tag but offers no compensation if the former club refuses to match the offer. [ 114 ] Due to that stipulation, the transition tag is rarely used, [ 115 ] even with the removal of the "poison pill" strategy (offering a contract with stipulations that the former club would be unable to match) that essentially ended the usage of the tag league-wide. [ 116 ] Each club is subject to a salary cap , which is set at $143.28 million for the 2015 season, $10 more than in 2014 and $20 million more than in 2013.

A total of 30 teams now play in the American League (AL) and National League (NL), with 15 teams in each league. The AL and NL operated as separate legal entities from 1901 and 1876 respectively. After cooperating but remaining legally separate entities since 1903, in 2000 the leagues merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball . [ 6 ] The organization also oversees minor league baseball leagues, which comprise about 240 teams affiliated with the major-league clubs. With the World Baseball Softball Confederation , the league manages the international World Baseball Classic tournament.  Baseball's first professional team was founded in Cincinnati in 1869. The first few decades of professional baseball were characterized by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team or league to another. The period before 1920 in baseball was known as the dead-ball era ; players rarely hit home runs during this time. Baseball survived a conspiracy to fix the 1919 World Series , which came to be known as the Black Sox Scandal . The sport rose in popularity in the 1920s, and survived potential downturns during the Great Depression and World War II . Shortly after the war, baseball's color barrier was broken by Jackie Robinson .  The 1950s and 1960s were a time of expansion for the AL and NL, then new stadiums and artificial turf surfaces began to change the game in the 1970s and 1980s. Home runs dominated the game during the 1990s, and media reports began to discuss the use of anabolic steroids among Major League players in the mid-2000s. In 2006, an investigation produced the Mitchell Report , which implicated many players in the use of performance-enhancing substances , including at least one player from each team.  Today, MLB is composed of thirty teams : twenty-nine in the United States and one in Canada. Teams play 162 games each season and five teams in each league advance to a four-round postseason tournament that culminates in the World Series , a best-of-seven championship series between the two league champions that dates to 1903. Baseball broadcasts are aired throughout North America and in several other countries throughout the world. Games are aired on television, radio, and the Internet. MLB has the highest season attendance of any sports league in the world with more than 74 million spectators in 2013.

This document has undergone several incarnations since 1875, with the most recent revisions being made in 2012. [ 8 ] Under the direction of the Commissioner of Baseball , MLB hires and maintains the sport's umpiring crews, and negotiates marketing, labor, and television contracts . MLB maintains a unique, controlling relationship over the sport, including most aspects of minor league baseball . This is due in large part to the 1922 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Federal Baseball Club v. National League , which held that baseball is not interstate commerce and therefore not subject to federal antitrust law. This ruling has been weakened only slightly in subsequent years. [ 9 ] The weakened ruling granted more stability to the owners of teams and has resulted in values increasing at double-digit rates. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] There were several challenges to MLB's primacy in the sport between the 1870s and the Federal League in 1916; the last attempt at a new major league was the aborted Continental League in 1960. [ 9 ]  The chief executive of MLB is the commissioner, Rob Manfred . The chief operating officer is Tony Petitti . There are six executive vice-presidents in charge of the following areas: baseball development, business, labor relations and human resources, finance, administration (whose vice-president is MLB's Chief Information Officer), and baseball operations. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] As of November 19, 2013, the MLB website lists only five executive VPs; the office of executive VP for labor relations and human resources is not listed. [ 11 ]  The multimedia branch of MLB, which is based in Manhattan , is MLB Advanced Media . This branch oversees MLB.com and each of the 30 teams' websites. Its charter states that MLB Advanced Media holds editorial independence from the league, but it is under the same ownership group and revenue-sharing plan. MLB Productions is a similarly structured wing of the league, focusing on video and traditional broadcast media. MLB also owns 67 percent of MLB Network , with the other 33 percent split between several cable operators and satellite provider DirecTV . [ 13 ] It operates out of studios in Secaucus, New Jersey , and also has editorial independence from the league. [ 14 ]  LEAGUE ORGANIZATION [ EDIT ] In 1920, the weak National Commission, which had been created to manage relationships between the two leagues, was replaced with the much more powerful Commissioner of Baseball, who had the power to make decisions for all of professional baseball unilaterally. [ 15 ] For 60 years, the American and National Leagues fielded eight teams apiece.  In the 1960s, MLB expansion added eight teams, including the first non-U.S. team (the Montreal Expos ). Two teams (the Seattle Mariners and the Toronto Blue Jays ) were also added in the 1970s. From 1969 through 1993, each league consisted of an East and West Division. A third division, the Central Division, was added in each league in 1994. Through 1996, the two leagues met on the field only during the World Series and the All-Star Game . Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997. [ 16 ]  In March 1995, two new franchises—the Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays (now known simply as the Tampa Bay Rays)—were awarded by MLB, to begin play in 1998. This addition brought the total number of franchises to 30. In early 1997, MLB decided to assign one new team to each league: Tampa Bay joined the AL and Arizona joined the NL. The original plan was to have an odd number of teams in each league (15 per league, with 5 in each division). In order for every team to be able to play daily, this would have required interleague play to be scheduled throughout the entire season. However, it was unclear at the time if interleague play would continue after the 1998 season, as it had to be approved by the players' union. For this and other reasons, it was decided that both leagues should continue to have an even number of teams; one existing club would have to switch leagues. The Milwaukee Brewers agreed in November 1997 to move from the AL to the NL, thereby making the NL a 16-team league. [ 17 ] Later, when the Houston Astros changed ownership prior to the 2013 season, the team moved from the NL Central to the AL West, [ 18 ] [ 19 ] resulting in both leagues having three divisions of five teams each and allowing all teams to have a more balanced schedule. [ 18 ] Interleague play is held throughout the season. [ 18 ]  In 2000, the AL and NL were dissolved as legal entities, and MLB became a single, overall league de jure, similar to the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL)—albeit with two components called "leagues" instead of "conferences". The same rules and regulations are used in both leagues, with one exception: the AL operates under the designated hitter rule, while the NL does not. [ 20 ] This difference in rules between leagues is unique to MLB; the other sports leagues of the U.S. and Canada have one set of rules for all teams.

BAL BOS NYY TB TOR CWS CLE DET KC MIN HOU LAA OAK SEA TEX ATL MIA NYM PHI WAS CHC CIN MIL PIT STL ARI COL LAD SD SFHISTORY [ EDIT ] Main article: History of baseball in the United StatesFOUNDING [ EDIT ] In the 1860s, aided by the Civil War , "New York"-style baseball expanded into a national game and spawned baseball's first governing body, The National Association of Base Ball Players . The NABBP existed as an amateur league for twelve years. By 1867, more than 400 clubs were members. Most of the strongest clubs remained those based in the northeastern U.S. For professional baseball 's founding year, MLB uses the year 1869—when the first professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings , was established. [ 51 ]  A schism developed between professional and amateur ballplayers after the founding of the Cincinnati club. The NABBP split into an amateur organization and a professional organization. The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players , often known as the National Association (NA), was formed in 1871. [ 52 ] Its amateur counterpart disappeared after only a few years. [ 53 ] The modern Chicago Cubs and Atlanta Braves franchises trace their histories back to the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players in the 1870s. [ 54 ]  In 1876, the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (later known as the National League or NL) was established after the NA proved ineffective. The league placed its emphasis on clubs rather than on players. Clubs could now enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs. Clubs were required to play the full schedule of games instead of forfeiting scheduled games when the club was no longer in the running for the league championship, which happened frequently under the NA. A concerted effort was made to curb gambling on games, which was leaving the validity of results in doubt. The first game in the NL—on Saturday, April 22, 1876 (at the Jefferson Street Grounds , Philadelphia)—is often pointed to as the beginning of MLB. [ 2 ] [ 55 ]  National League Baltimore Orioles , 1896The early years of the NL were tumultuous, with threats from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated "reserve clause", which restricted the free movement of players between clubs. Competitor leagues formed regularly and also disbanded regularly. The most successful was the American Association (1882–1891), sometimes called the "beer and whiskey league" for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators. For several years, the NL and American Association champions met in a postseason championship series—the first attempt at a World Series . The two leagues merged in 1892 as a single 12-team NL, but the NL dropped four teams after the 1899 season. This led to the formation of the American League in 1901 under AL president Ban Johnson , and the resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes.  The war between the AL and NL caused shock waves throughout the baseball world. At a meeting at the Leland Hotel in Chicago in 1901, the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence. A new National Association was formed to oversee these minor leagues. [ 56 ] While the NA continues to this day (known as Minor League Baseball ), at the time Ban Johnson saw it as a tool to end threats from smaller rivals who might expand in other territories and threaten his league's dominance.  After 1902, the NL, AL, and NA signed a new National Agreement which tied independent contracts to the reserve-clause contracts. The agreement also set up a formal classification system for minor leagues, the forerunner of today's system that was refined by Branch Rickey . [ 57 ]  Several other early defunct baseball leagues are officially considered major leagues, and their statistics and records are included with those of the two current major leagues. These include the AA, the Union Association (1884), [ 58 ] the Players' League (1890), [ 59 ] and the Federal League (1914–1915). [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Both the UA and AA are considered major leagues by many baseball researchers [ who? ] because of the perceived high caliber of play and the number of star players featured. Some researchers [ who? ] dispute the major-league status of the UA by pointing out that franchises came and went and that the St. Louis club was deliberately "stacked"; the St. Louis club was owned by the league's president and it was the only club that was close to major-league caliber. [ 62 ]  DEAD-BALL ERA [ EDIT ] Main article: Dead-ball era Cy Young, 1911 baseball cardThe period between 1900 and 1919 is commonly called the "dead-ball era". Games of this era tended to be low scoring and were often dominated by pitchers, such as Walter Johnson , Cy Young , Christy Mathewson , Mordecai Brown , and Grover Cleveland Alexander . The term also accurately describes the condition of the baseball itself. The baseball used American rather than the modern Australian wool yarn and was not wound as tightly as it would become later, affecting the distance that it would travel. [ 63 ] More significantly, balls were kept in play until they were mangled, soft and sometimes lopsided: a baseball cost three dollars, equal to $40.81 today (in inflation -adjusted U.S. dollars ), and owners were reluctant to purchase new balls. Fans were expected to throw back fouls and (rare) home runs. Baseballs also became stained with tobacco juice, grass, and mud, and sometimes the juice of licorice, which some players would chew for the purpose of discoloring the ball. [ 64 ]  Also, pitchers could manipulate the ball through the use of the spitball . (In 1921 use of this pitch was restricted to a few pitchers with a grandfather clause ). Additionally, many ballparks had large dimensions, such as the West Side Grounds of the Chicago Cubs, which was 560 feet (170 m) to the center field fence, and the Huntington Avenue Grounds of the Boston Red Sox , which was 635 feet (194 m) to the center field fence, thus home runs were rare, and "small ball" tactics such as singles , bunts , stolen bases , and the hit-and-run play dominated the strategies of the time. [ 65 ] Hitting methods like the Baltimore Chop were used to increase the number of infield singles. [ 66 ] On a successful Baltimore chop, the batter hits the ball forcefully into the ground, causing it to bounce so high that the batter reaches first base before the ball can be fielded and thrown to the first baseman. [ 67 ]  The adoption of the foul strike rule in the early twentieth century quickly sent baseball from a high-scoring game to one where scoring runs became a struggle. Prior to the institution of this rule, foul balls were not counted as strikes: a batter could foul off any number of pitches with no strikes counted against him; this gave an enormous advantage to the batter. In 1901, the NL adopted the foul strike rule, and the AL followed suit in 1903. [ 68 ]  After the 1919 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds, baseball was rocked by allegations of a game fixing scheme known as the Black Sox Scandal . Eight players— Joe Jackson , Eddie Cicotte , Claude Williams , Buck Weaver , Arnold "Chick" Gandil , Fred McMullin , Charles Risberg , and Oscar "Happy" Felsch —intentionally lost the World Series in exchange for a ring worth $100,000. [ 69 ] Despite being acquitted, all were permanently banned from Major League Baseball. [ 70 ]  RISE IN POPULARITY [ EDIT ] Baseball's popularity increased in the 1920s and 1930s. The 1920 season was notable for the death of Ray Chapman of the Cleveland Indians . Chapman, who was struck in the head by a pitch and died a few hours later, became the only MLB player to die of an on-field injury, a tragedy which led directly to both leagues requiring the placing into play new, white baseballs whenever a ball became scuffed or dirty, helping bring the "dead-ball" era to an end. The following year, the New York Yankees made their first World Series appearance. [ 71 ] By the end of the 1930s, the team had appeared in 11 World Series, winning eight of them. [ 72 ] Yankees slugger Babe Ruth had set the single season home run record in 1927, hitting 60 home runs; a few years earlier, Ruth had set the same record with 29 home runs. [ 73 ]  Affected by the difficulties of the Great Depression , baseball's popularity had begun a downward turn in the early 1930s. By 1932, only two MLB teams turned a profit. Attendance had fallen, due at least in part to a 10% federal amusement tax added to baseball ticket prices. Baseball owners cut their rosters from 25 men to 23 men, and even the best players took pay cuts. Team executives were innovative in their attempts to survive, creating night games, broadcasting games live by radio and rolling out promotions such as free admission for women. Throughout the period of the Great Depression, no MLB teams moved or folded. [ 74 ]  WORLD WAR II ERA [ EDIT ] The onset of World War II created a significant shortage of professional baseball players, as more than 500 men left MLB teams to serve in the military. Many of them played on service baseball teams that entertained military personnel in the US or in the Pacific. MLB teams of this time largely consisted of young men, older players, and those with a military classification of 4F , indicating mental, physical, or moral unsuitability for service. Men like Pete Gray , a one-armed outfielder, got the chance to advance to the major leagues. However, MLB rosters did not include any black players through the end of the war. [ 75 ] Black players, many of whom served in the war, were still restricted to playing Negro league baseball . [ 76 ]  Wartime blackout restrictions , designed to keep outdoor lighting at low levels, caused another problem for baseball. These rules limited traveling and night games to the point that the 1942 season nearly had to be cancelled. [ 76 ] On January 14, 1942, MLB Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis wrote a letter to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and pleaded for the continuation of baseball during the war in hopes for a start of a new major league season. President Roosevelt responded, "I honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going. There will be fewer people unemployed and everybody will work longer hours and harder than ever before. And that means that they ought to have a chance for recreation and for taking their minds off their work even more than before." [ 77 ]  With the approval of President Roosevelt, spring training began in 1942 with few repercussions. The war interrupted the careers of stars including Stan Musial , Ted Williams , and Joe DiMaggio , but baseball clubs continued to field their teams. [ 78 ]  BREAKING THE COLOR BARRIER [ EDIT ] Branch Rickey, president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began making efforts to introduce a black baseball player to the previously all-white professional baseball leagues in the mid-1940s. He selected Jackie Robinson from a list of promising Negro league players. After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to "turn the other cheek" to any racial antagonism directed at him, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month. In what was later referred to as "The Noble Experiment", Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s, joining the Dodgers' farm club, the Montreal Royals , for the 1946 season. [ 79 ]  The following year, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues. On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, including more than 14,000 black patrons. Black baseball fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning their Negro league teams which they had followed exclusively. Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players. Manager Leo Durocher informed his team, "I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded." [ 80 ]  After a strike threat by some players, NL President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler let it be known that any striking players would be suspended. Robinson received significant encouragement from several major league players, including Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese who said, "You can hate a man for many reasons. Color is not one of them." [ 81 ] That year, Robinson earned the inaugural Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award (separate NL and AL Rookie of the Year honors were not awarded until 1949). [ 82 ]  Less than three months later, Larry Doby became the first African-American to break the color barrier in the American League with the Cleveland Indians. [ 83 ] The next year, a number of other black players entered the major leagues. Satchel Paige was signed by the Indians and the Dodgers added star catcher Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe , who was later the first winner of the Cy Young Award for his outstanding pitching. [ 84 ]  BAN ON WOMEN [ EDIT ] Major League Baseball banned the signing of women to contracts in 1952, and that ban lasted until 1992. [ 85 ]  EXPANDING WEST, SOUTH, AND NORTH [ EDIT ] Main article: Major League Baseball relocation of 1950s-1960s Dodger Stadium in 2007From 1903 to 1953, the two major leagues consisted of two eight-team leagues. The 16 teams were located in ten cities, all in the northeastern and midwestern United States: New York City had three teams and Boston , Chicago , Philadelphia , and St. Louis each had two teams. St. Louis was the southernmost and westernmost city with a major league team. The longest possible road trip, from Boston to St. Louis, took about 24 hours by railroad. In 1953, the NL's Boston Braves became the Milwaukee Braves . In 1954, the St. Louis Browns became the Baltimore Orioles . In 1955, the Philadelphia Athletics became the Kansas City Athletics .  Baseball experts consider the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers' boss Walter O'Malley to be "perhaps the most influential owner of baseball's early expansion era." [ 86 ] Before the 1958 Major League Baseball season , he moved the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles. [ 87 ] When O'Malley moved the Dodgers from Brooklyn, he appeared on the cover of TIME . [ 88 ] O'Malley was also influential in persuading the rival New York Giants to move west to become the San Francisco Giants. The Giants were already suffering from slumping attendance records at their aging ballpark, the Polo Grounds . Had the Dodgers moved out west alone, the St. Louis Cardinals —1,600 mi (2,575 km) away [ 89 ] [ 90 ] —would have been the closest NL team. The joint move made West Coast road trips economical for visiting teams. [ 91 ] O'Malley invited San Francisco Mayor George Christopher to New York to meet with Giants owner Horace Stoneham . [ 91 ] Stoneham was considering moving the Giants to Minnesota , [ 92 ] but he was convinced to join O'Malley on the West Coast at the end of 1957. The meetings between Stoneham, Christopher and O'Malley occurred against the wishes of Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick. [ 93 ] The dual moves were successful for both franchises—and for MLB. [ 87 ] The Dodgers set a single-game MLB attendance record in their first home appearance with 78,672 fans. [ 91 ]  In 1961, the first Washington Senators franchise moved to Minneapolis–St. Paul to become the Minnesota Twins . Two new teams were added to the American League at the same time: the Los Angeles Angels (who soon moved from downtown L.A. to nearby Anaheim ) and a new Washington Senators franchise. The NL added the Houston Astros and the New York Mets in 1962. The Astros (known as the "Colt .45s" during their first three seasons) became the first southern major league franchise since the Louisville Colonels folded in 1899 and the first franchise to be located along the Gulf Coast . The Mets established a reputation for futility by going 40–120 during their first season of play in the nation's media capital—and by playing only a little better in subsequent campaigns—but in their eighth season ( 1969 ) the Mets became the first of the 1960s expansion teams to win a World Series.  In 1966, the major leagues moved to the "Deep South" when the Braves moved to Atlanta. In 1968, the Kansas City Athletics moved west to become the Oakland Athletics . In 1969, the American and National Leagues both added two expansion franchises . The American League added the Seattle Pilots (who became the Milwaukee Brewers after one disastrous season in Seattle) and the Kansas City Royals . The NL added the first Canadian franchise, the Montreal Expos, as well as the San Diego Padres .  In 1972, the second Washington Senators moved to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex to become the Texas Rangers . In 1977, baseball expanded again , adding a second Canadian team, the Toronto Blue Jays, as well as the Seattle Mariners. Subsequently, no new teams were added and no teams moved until the 1990s. In 1993, the NL added the Florida Marlins in the Miami area and the Colorado Rockies in Denver. In 1998, the Brewers switched leagues by joining the National League and two new teams were added: the NL's Arizona Diamondbacks in Phoenix and the American League's Tampa Bay Devil Rays in St. Petersburg, Florida .  After the 2001 season, the team owners voted in favor of contraction. Several MLB teams had been considered for elimination in early talks about contraction, but the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins were the two teams that came closest to folding under the plan. Plans for MLB contraction were halted when the Twins landlord was awarded a court injunction that required the team to play its 2002 home games at their stadium. MLB owners agreed to hold off on reducing the league's size until at least 2006. [ 94 ]  The Montreal Expos became the first franchise in over three decades to move when they became the Washington Nationals in 2005. This move left Canada with just one team, but it also returned baseball to the United States capital city after a 33-year absence. This franchise shift, like many previous ones, involved baseball's return to a city which had been previously abandoned. Not counting the short-lived Federal League, Montreal is the only city granted an MLB franchise since 1901 that does not currently host a team.  PITCHING DOMINANCE AND RULE CHANGES [ EDIT ] Graph showing, by year, the average number of runs per MLB gameBy the late 1960s, the balance between pitching and hitting had swung in favor of the pitchers. In 1968—later nicknamed "the year of the pitcher" [ 95 ] —Boston Red Sox player Carl Yastrzemski won the American League batting title with an average of just .301, the lowest in the history of Major League Baseball. [ 96 ] Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain won 31 games, making him the only pitcher to win 30 games in a season since Dizzy Dean in 1934. [ 97 ] St. Louis Cardinals starting pitcher Bob Gibson achieved an equally remarkable feat by allowing an ERA of just 1.12. [ 98 ]  Following these pitching performances, in December 1968 the MLB Playing Rules Committee voted to reduce the strike zone from knees to shoulders to top of knees to armpits and lower the pitcher's mound from 15 to 10 inches, beginning in the 1969 season. [ 99 ]  In 1973 the American League, which had been suffering from much lower attendance than the National League, sought to increase scoring even further by initiating the designated hitter (DH) rule. [ 100 ]  NEW STADIUMS AND ARTIFICIAL SURFACES [ EDIT ] Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, as baseball expanded, NFL football had been surging in popularity, making it economical for many of these cities to build multi-purpose stadiums instead of single-purpose baseball fields. Because of climate and economic issues many of these facilities had playing surfaces made from artificial turf , as well as the oval designs characteristic of stadiums designed to house both baseball and football. [ 101 ] This often resulted in baseball fields with relatively more foul territory than older stadiums. These characteristics changed the nature of professional baseball, putting a higher premium on speed and defense over home-run hitting power, since the fields were often too big for teams to expect to hit many home runs and foul balls hit in the air could more easily be caught for outs.  Teams began to be built around pitching—particularly their bullpens—and speed on the basepaths. Artificial surfaces meant balls traveled quicker and bounced higher, so it became easier to hit ground balls " in the hole " between the corner and middle infielders. Starting pitchers were no longer expected to throw complete games ; it was enough for a starter to go 6–7 innings and turn the game over to the team's closer , a position which grew in importance over these decades. As stolen bases increased, home run totals dropped. After Willie Mays hit 52 home runs in 1965, only one player ( George Foster ) reached that mark until the 1990s.  POWER AGE [ EDIT ] Routinely in the late 1990s and early 2000s, baseball players hit 40 or 50 home runs in a season, a feat that was considered rare even in the 1980s. It has since become apparent that at least some of this power surge was a result of players using steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. Many modern baseball theorists believe that the need of pitchers to combat the rise in power could lead to a pitching revolution at some point. New pitches, such as the mysterious [ 102 ] gyroball , could shift the balance of power back to the defensive side. Several pitches have changed the game of baseball, including the slider in the 1950s and 60s and the split-fingered fastball in the 1970s to 90s. Since the 1990s, the changeup has made a resurgence, being thrown masterfully by pitchers such as Trevor Hoffman , Greg Maddux , Jamie Moyer , Tom Glavine , Johan Santana , Pedro Martínez and Tim Lincecum . Recently, pitchers such as Lincecum, Jonathan Sánchez , and Ubaldo Jiménez have been throwing changeups with a split-finger grip, creating a dropping movement, dubbed the "split change." [ 103 ] [ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ]  UNIFORMS [ EDIT ] Main articles: Major League Baseball uniforms and Baseball uniform A baseball team and its uniforms in the 1870sA baseball uniform is a type of uniform worn by baseball players , and by some non-playing personnel, such as field managers and coaches. It is worn to indicate the person's role in the game and—through the use of logos, colors, and numbers —to identify the teams and their players, managers, and coaches. [ 107 ]  Traditionally, home uniforms display the team name on the front, while away uniforms display the team's home location. In modern times, however, exceptions to this pattern have become common, with teams using their team name on both uniforms. [ 108 ] Most teams also have one or more alternate uniforms , usually consisting of the primary or secondary team color on the vest instead of the usual white or gray. [ 108 ] In the past few decades throwback uniforms have become popular. [ 109 ]  The New York Knickerbockers were the first baseball team to use uniforms, taking the field on April 4, 1849, in pants made of blue wool, white flannel shirts ( jerseys ) and straw hats . [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] Caps and other types of headgear have been a part of baseball uniforms from the beginning. [ 113 ] [ 114 ] Baseball teams often wore full-brimmed straw hats or no cap at all since there was no official rule regarding headgear. [ 115 ] Under the 1882 uniform rules, players on the same team wore uniforms of different colors and patterns that indicated which position they played. [ 116 ]  In the late 1880s, the Detroit Wolverines and Washington Nationals of the National League and the Brooklyn Bridegrooms of the American Association were the first to wear striped uniforms. [ 117 ] By the end of the 19th century, teams began the practice of having two different uniforms, one for when they played at home in their own baseball stadium and a different one for when they played away ( on the road ) at the other team's ballpark. [ 108 ] It became common to wear white pants with a white color vest at home and gray pants with a gray or solid (dark) colored vest when away. [ 108 ] By 1900, both home and away uniforms were standard across the major leagues. [ 118 ]  SEASON STRUCTURE [ EDIT ] Main article: Major League Baseball scheduleSPRING TRAINING [ EDIT ] Main article: Spring training A Grapefruit League game at the former Los Angeles Dodgers camp in Vero Beach , FloridaSpring training is a series of practices and exhibition games preceding the start of the regular season . Spring training allows new players to audition for roster and position spots, and gives existing team players practice time prior to competitive play. The teams are divided into the Cactus League [ 119 ] and the Grapefruit League . [ 120 ] Spring training has always attracted fan attention, drawing crowds who travel to the warmer climates to enjoy the weather and watch their favorite teams play, and spring training usually coincides with spring break for many college students. Autograph seekers also find greater access to players during spring training.  Spring training typically lasts almost two months, starting in mid February and running until just before the season opening day, traditionally the first week of April. As pitchers benefit from a longer training period, pitchers and catchers begin spring training several days before the rest of the team. [ 121 ]  REGULAR SEASON [ EDIT ] The current MLB regular season consists of 162 games per team, which typically begins on the first Sunday in April and ends on the first Sunday in October. Each team's schedule is organized typically into 3-game series, with occasional two- or four-game series. [ 122 ] Postponed games or continuations of suspended games can result in an ad hoc one-game or five-game series. A team's series are organized into homestands and road trips that group multiple series together. Teams generally play games five to seven days per week, commonly having Monday or Thursday as an off day. Frequently, games are scheduled at night . Sunday games are generally played during the afternoon, allowing teams to travel to their next destination prior to a Monday night game. In addition, teams will play day games frequently on Opening Day, holidays, and getaway days.  Each team plays 19 games against each of its four divisional opponents. It plays one home series and one away series, amounting to 6 or 7 games, against the 10 other teams in its league. A team also plays one of the divisions in the other league, rotating each year, with two opponents in a 3-game home series, two in a 3-game away series, and one with four games split between home and away. Furthermore, each team has an interleague "natural rival" (in many cases its counterpart in the same metro area) with which it plays 2 home games and 2 away games each year.  With an odd number of teams in each league (15), it is necessary to have two teams participate in interleague play for most days in the season, except when two or more teams have a day off. Each team plays 20 interleague games throughout the season, usually with just one interleague game per day, but for one weekend in late May all teams will participate in an interleague series. Use of the DH rule is determined by the home team's league rules. Before 2013 interleague play was structured differently: there would be one weekend in mid-May and another period consisting typically of the last two-thirds of June in which all teams played interleague games (save for two NL teams each day), and no interleague games were scheduled outside those dates.  Over the course of a season, teams compete for one of the five playoff berths in their league. They can win one of these berths by either winning their division , or by capturing a wild card spot . [ 123 ]  After the conclusion of the 162-game season, an additional tie-breaking game (or games) may be needed to determine postseason participation. [ 124 ]  ALL-STAR GAME [ EDIT ] Main article: Major League Baseball All-Star Game President John F. Kennedy throwing out the first pitch at the 1962 All-Star Game at DC StadiumIn early-to-mid July, just after the midway point of the season, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game is held during a four-day break from the regular-season schedule. The All-Star game features a team of players from the American League (AL)—led by the manager of the previous AL World Series team—and a team of players from the National League (NL), similarly managed, in an exhibition game. From 1959 to 1961, two games were held each season, seven were held in July and one was held in August. The designated-hitter rule was used in the All-Star game for the first time in 1989. Following games used a DH when the game was played in an AL ballpark. Since 2010, the DH rule has been in effect regardless of venue. [ 125 ]  The first official All-Star Game was held as part of the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois, and was the idea of Arch Ward , then sports editor for The Chicago Tribune . [ 126 ] Initially intended to be a one-time event, its great success resulted in making the game an annual one. Ward's contribution was recognized by Major League Baseball in 1962 with the creation of the "Arch Ward Trophy", given to the All-Star Game's Most Valuable Player each year. [ 127 ] (In 2002, this was renamed the Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award .)  Beginning in 1947, the eight position players in each team's starting lineup have been voted into the game by fans. [ 128 ] The fan voting was discontinued after a 1957 ballot-box-stuffing scandal in Cincinnati: seven of the eight slots originally went to Reds players, two of whom were subsequently removed from the lineup to make room for Willie Mays and Hank Aaron . Fan voting was reinstated in 1970 and has continued ever since, including Internet voting in recent years.  The 2002 contest in Milwaukee controversially ended in an 11-inning tie. Since 2003, the league which wins the All-Star game gets home-field advantage in the World Series: the league champion hosts the first two games at its own ballpark as well as the last two (if necessary). The National League did not win an All-Star game and thus gain home-field advantage until 2010; it was able to overcome this disadvantage and win in three of the seven World Series from 2003 to 2009. [ 129 ] [ 130 ]  MLB All-Star game players from both leagues have worn their team uniforms at the game with one exception. In the 1933 All-Star Game , the National League All-Star Team members wore special gray uniforms with "National League" written in navy blue letters across the front of the jersey.

More detail at World Series and List of World Series champions Source: MLB.comWhen the regular season ends after the first Sunday in October (or the last Sunday in September), ten teams enter the postseason playoffs. These ten teams consist of six teams that are division champions by earning the best regular season overall win-loss record for their respective divisions, and four who are "wild-card" teams that are each one of two teams in their respective leagues who have earned the best regular season win-loss record, but are not division champions. Four rounds of series of games are played to determine the champion:   1. Wild Card Game , a one-game playoff between the two wild-card teams in each league.  2. American League Division Series and National League Division Series , each a best-of-five-games series.  3. American League Championship Series and National League Championship Series , each a best-of-seven-games series played between the surviving teams from the ALDS and NLDS. The league champions are informally referred to as the AL and NL pennant winners.  4. World Series , a best-of-seven-games series played between the pennant winners of each league.  Within each league, the division winners are the #1, #2 and #3 seeds, based on win–loss records. The team with the best record among non division winners will be the first wildcard and the #4 seed. The team with the second best record among non division winners will be the second wildcard and the #5 seed. In the wildcard round, the #5 seed will play at the #4 seed in a one-game playoff. For the division series, the matchup will be the #1 seed against the Wild Card Game winner and the #2 seed against the #3 seed. [ 133 ] The team belonging to the league that won the mid-season All-Star Game receives home-field advantage in the World Series.  Because each postseason series is split between the home fields of the two teams, home-field advantage does not usually play a large role in the postseason unless the series goes to its maximum number of games, giving one team an additional game at home. However, the first two games of a postseason series are hosted by the same team. That team may have an increased chance of starting the series with two wins, [ 134 ] thereby gaining some momentum for the rest of the series. [ 135 ]  Use of the DH rule in the World Series is determined by the home team's league rules. [ 136 ]  INTERNATIONAL PLAY [ EDIT ] Between 1986 and 2006, a team of MLB All-Stars made a biennial end-of-the-season tour of Japan, playing exhibition games against the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) All-Stars in the MLB Japan All-Star Series . The All-Star Series continued again after an eight-year break. For the first time in series history, NPB is represented by their national team Samurai Japan in the 2014 series .  In 2008, MLB played the MLB China Series in the People's Republic of China. It was a series of two spring-training games played by the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers. The games were an effort to popularize baseball in China. [ 137 ]  MLB played the MLB Taiwan Series in Taiwan in November 2011. It was a series of five exhibition games played by a team made up of MLB players called the MLB All-Stars and the Chinese Taipei National Team. The MLB All-Stars swept the series, five games to zero. [ 138 ] At the end of the 2011 season, it was announced that the Seattle Mariners and the Oakland Athletics would play their season openers in Japan. [ 139 ] In October 2013, Phil Rogers of the Chicago Tribune wrote that MLB was considering postseason all-star tours in Taiwan and Korea; baseball is increasing in popularity in both countries. [ 140 ]  The Arizona Diamondbacks opened the 2014 season against Los Angeles Dodgers on March 22–23 in Australia . [ 141 ] The teams played each other at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground , which has a seating capacity of 46,000. The two games represented the first MLB regular-season play held in that country. The games counted as home games for the Diamondbacks, so they played 79 home games at Chase Field . [ 142 ]  Together with the World Baseball Softball Confederation , MLB sponsors the World Baseball Classic , an international baseball tournament contested by national teams.  STEROIDS IN BASEBALL [ EDIT ] See also: Banned substances in baseball in the United States and List of Major League Baseball players suspended for performance-enhancing drugs Rafael Palmeiro (batter), one of the MLB players suspended for steroid use [ 143 ]In 1998, both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa hit more than the long-standing single-season MLB record of 61 home runs. Barry Bonds topped the record in 2001 with 73 home runs. McGwire, Bonds and Sosa became the subjects of speculation regarding the use of performance-enhancing substances. McGwire later admitted that he used a steroid hormone that was still legal in baseball during the 1998 season. [ 144 ] Baseball's original steroid testing policy, in effect from 2002 to 2005, provided for penalties ranging from a ten-game suspension for a first positive test to a one-year suspension for a fourth positive test. Players were tested at least once per year, with the chance that several players could be tested many times per year. [ 145 ]  A 2006 book, Game of Shadows by San Francisco Chronicle investigative reporters Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada , chronicled alleged extensive use of performance enhancers, including several types of steroids and growth hormone by baseball superstars Barry Bonds, Gary Sheffield , and Jason Giambi . Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell was appointed by Selig on March 30, 2006 [ 146 ] to investigate the use of performance-enhancing drugs in MLB. The appointment was made after several influential members of the U.S. Congress made negative comments about both the effectiveness and honesty of MLB's drug policies and Commissioner Selig. [ 147 ]  The day before the Mitchell Report was to be released in 2007, Selig said, "I haven't seen the report yet, but I'm proud I did it." [ 148 ] [ 149 ] The report said that after mandatory random testing began in 2004, HGH treatment for athletic enhancement became popular among players, as HGH is not detectable in tests. It pointed out that HGH is likely a placebo with no performance-enhancing effects. [ 150 ] The report included substance use allegations against at least one player from each MLB team. [ 151 ]  According to ESPN , some people questioned whether Mitchell's director role with the Boston Red Sox created a conflict of interest, especially because no "prime [Sox] players were in the report." [ 152 ] The report named several prominent Yankees who were parts of World Series clubs; there is a long-running and fierce Yankees–Red Sox rivalry . Former U.S. prosecutor John M. Dowd brought up Mitchell's conflict of interest, [ 153 ] but he later said that the former senator had done a good job. [ 154 ] Mitchell acknowledged that his "tight relationship with Major League Baseball left him open to criticism", [ 155 ] but he said that readers who examine the report closely "will not find any evidence of bias, of special treatment of the Red Sox". [ 155 ]  On January 10, 2013, MLB and the players union reached an agreement to add random, in-season HGH testing. They also agreed to implement a new test to reveal the use of testosterone for the 2013 season. [ 156 ] The current MLB drug policy provides for a 50-game suspension for a first positive test, a 100-game suspension for a second positive test, and a lifetime suspension for a third positive test. [ 157 ] In 2009, allegations surfaced against Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz , and Manny Ramirez received a 50-game suspension after testing positive for banned substances. In early April 2011, Ramirez retired from baseball rather than face a 100-game suspension for his second positive steroid test. [ 158 ]  MLB IN MEDIA [ EDIT ] TELEVISION [ EDIT ] Main article: Major League Baseball television contractsSeveral networks televise baseball games, including Fox , ESPN, and MLB Network. Since 2008, Fox Sports has broadcast MLB games on Fox Saturday Baseball throughout the entire season; Fox previously only broadcast games from May to September. [ 159 ] Fox also holds rights to the All-Star Game each season. Fox also alternates League Championship Series broadcasts, broadcasting the American League Championship Series (ALCS) in odd-numbered years and the National League Championship Series (NLCS) in even-numbered years. Fox broadcasts all games of the World Series. ESPN continues to broadcast MLB games through 2013 as well, beginning with national Opening Day coverage. [ 160 ] ESPN broadcasts Sunday Night Baseball , Monday Night Baseball , Wednesday Night Baseball , and Baseball Tonight . ESPN also has rights to the Home Run Derby at the All-Star Game each July. [ 149 ]  TBS airs Sunday afternoon regular season games (non-exclusive) nationally. In 2007, TBS began its exclusive rights to any tiebreaker games that determine division or wild card champions; it also airs exclusive coverage of the Division Series round of the playoffs. [ 161 ] TBS carries the League Championship Series that are not included under Fox's television agreement; TBS shows the NLCS in odd-numbered years and the ALCS in even-numbered years. [ 162 ]  In January 2009, MLB launched the MLB Network, featuring news and coverage from around the league, and airing 26 live games in the 2009 season. [ 163 ] Each team also has local broadcasts for all games not carried by Fox on Saturdays or ESPN on Sunday nights. These games are typically split between a local broadcast television station and a local or regional sports network (RSN), though some teams only air local games through RSNs or through their own team networks. As Canada only contains one team, Sportsnet broadcasts Toronto Blue Jays games nationally. [ 164 ] The channel is owned by Rogers Communications , who is also the parent company of the Blue Jays. [ 164 ] Sportsnet also televises Fox's Saturday afternoon games, the All-Star Game, playoff games, and the World Series. [ 164 ] [ 165 ] In April 2011, TSN2 began carrying ESPN Sunday Night Baseball in Canada. [ 166 ]  BLACKOUT POLICY [ EDIT ] Main article: Major League Baseball blackout policy See also: Syndication exclusivity MLB blackout map in the United States Canadian MLB blackout mapMLB has several blackout rules. [ 167 ] A local broadcaster has priority to televise games of the team in their market over national broadcasters. For example, at one time TBS showed many Atlanta Braves games nationally and internationally in Canada. Fox Sports Networks also show many games in other areas. If the Braves played a team that FSN or another local broadcaster showed, the local station will have the broadcast rights for its own local market, while TBS would have been blacked out in the same market during the game. A market that has a local team playing in a weekday ESPN or ESPN2 game and is shown on a local station will see ESPNews , or, in the past, another game scheduled on ESPN or ESPN2 at the same time (if ESPN or ESPN2 operates a regional coverage broadcasting and operates a game choice), or will be subject to an alternative programming feed. [ 168 ] MLB's streaming Internet video service is also subject to the same blackout rules.  RADIO AND INTERNET [ EDIT ] Main article: Major League Baseball on the radioESPN Radio holds national broadcast rights and broadcasts Sunday Night Baseball weekly throughout the season in addition to all playoff games. [ 169 ] The rights to the World Series are exclusive to ESPN.  In addition, each team employs its own announcers, who broadcast during the regular season. Most teams operate regional networks to cover their fan bases; some of these supposedly regional networks (such as the New York Yankees Radio Network ) have a national reach with affiliates located across the United States. [ 170 ] Major League Baseball has an exclusive rights deal with XM Satellite Radio , which includes the channel MLB Network Radio and live play-by-play of all games. [ 171 ]  MLB games are also broadcast live on the internet. All television and radio broadcasts of games are available via subscription to MLB.tv at Major League Baseball's website, MLB.com, and radio-only broadcasts are also available via subscription to MLB.com Gameday Audio. [ 172 ] Blackout rules are still applied for live television broadcasts, but not radio broadcasts.  INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING [ EDIT ] ESPN Deportes televises a large number of MLB games in Spanish throughout Latin America. [ 173 ] Wapa 2 airs games in Puerto Rico , including spring training games and most of the World Baseball Classic games involving the team from Puerto Rico. [ 174 ] In Brazil, ESPN Brasil has exclusive rights on TV ( ESPN and ESPN+) and Internet ( WatchESPN ), [ 175 ] with Fox Sports also broadcasting some games.  Five in the United Kingdom previously screened MLB games, including the All-Star Game and the postseason games, on Sunday and Wednesday usually starting at 1 am BST . Most recently, Johnny Gould and Josh Chetwynd presented " MLB on Five " on that station. [ 176 ] The channel covered baseball beginning on its opening night in 1997, but for financial reasons, the decision was made not to pick up MLB for the 2009 season. [ 177 ] ESPN UK show live and recorded games several times a week—it is available with BT Sport and (on a subscriber-basis) Virgin Media in the UK.
